20913276,Ghoomer,Drama Sport hand batting cricketer village ball accident tic cricket lost unconventional style turned story,Drama Sport prodigy loses accident young batting hand unsympathetic failed hope trains techniques cricketer unconventional turn fate Ghoomer invent style bowling,"Anina, a young batting prodigy, loses her right hand in an accident. An unsympathetic, failed cricketer gives her new hope, trains her with unconventional techniques, to turn her fate around. Ghoomer is a new style of bowling they invent. Once upon a time, in a small village on the outskirts of Mumbai, there lived a young girl named Anina. She was a cricket prodigy, the talk of the town, and the pride of her family. With her astonishing batting skills, Anina had dreams of one day representing India on the international stage. But fate had a different plan for her.

One sunny afternoon, while playing near the local river, a tragic accident occurred. Anina, in an attempt to retrieve a ball that had fallen into the fast-flowing water, lost her balance and slipped. Before anyone could react, her right hand was trapped in the sharp rocks, and she screamed in pain. The accident left her hand severely injured, and the doctors had no choice but to amputate it.

Devastated by the loss of her hand and, seemingly, her dreams, Anina fell into a deep depression. She withdrew from the world of cricket, believing that she would never be able to bat again. The villagers, who had once cheered for her, now whispered about her downfall and the unfortunate turn of events.

But one man, Amar, a failed cricketer himself who had once aspired to make it big in the sport, refused to give up on Anina. He had a reputation for being stubborn and unsympathetic, but he saw something in Anina that no one else did – her unyielding spirit.

Amar decided to visit Anina, offering her a glimmer of hope. He shared his own story of failure and heartbreak, making her understand that life sometimes takes unexpected turns. He said, ""You may have lost your hand, but you haven't lost your heart, your passion, or your skill. We just need to adapt.""

With Amar's encouragement, Anina began to train again. They experimented with unconventional techniques, using her left hand for balance and a specially designed prosthetic glove on her right arm for support. Her determination was unwavering, and her frustration turned into a burning desire to prove herself.

As they worked tirelessly day in and day out, Amar introduced Anina to a new style of bowling they called ""Ghoomer."" It involved spinning the ball in such a way that it moved unpredictably in the air and was challenging for the batter to predict. Amar believed that if they could perfect this unique technique, it could give Anina the edge she needed to return to the game at a competitive level.

The months turned into years, and Anina's story became an inspiration for many in the village. Her family, once worried about her future, now watched her with pride. As the days went by, Anina's proficiency in Ghoomer grew, and her left-handed batting skills evolved to counter any challenge. Her ability to read the bowler's intentions, adapt to the ever-changing Ghoomer, and play with her newfound determination made her an unstoppable force on the pitch.

The day of her comeback finally arrived when a local cricket tournament took place in their village. Anina, now with the entire village cheering her on, strode onto the field with Amar by her side. The crowd watched in awe as she faced a renowned bowler, who had underestimated her due to her disability.

The first ball he bowled was a Ghoomer, and it curved in the air with unpredictable spin. Anina, with her left-handed stance, confidently leaned into the ball and sent it sailing over the boundary for a six. The crowd erupted in jubilation, and Amar couldn't hide his pride.

Anina continued to excel in the tournament, her unique batting style confounding even the most skilled bowlers. She earned a reputation not only as a survivor but as an exceptional cricketer who had turned adversity into an advantage.

Her journey from tragedy to triumph became the stuff of legends in the cricketing world. Anina was invited to train and play for various domestic teams, and eventually, she made it to the national team, becoming the first one-handed cricketer to represent India. Her story served as an inspiration to countless individuals facing adversity, proving that with determination, unconventional thinking, and the support of a dedicated mentor, even the darkest of days can lead to the brightest of achievements.","['Drama', 'Sport']","Anina, a young batting prodigy, loses her right hand in an accident.

It focuses on the forced exodus of Kashmiri Hindu Pandits from the Kashmir Valley due to the insurgency and militant violence. The story unfolds as follows:

In 1989-90, Islamic militants violently storm and expel the Kashmiri Hindu Pandits from their homes in the Kashmir Valley, using the slogans ""convert , leave, or die."" Pushkar Nath Pandit, a teacher, is deeply concerned for the safety of his son Karan, accused of being an Indian spy by the militants. Pushkar seeks the help of his friend Brahma Dutt, a civil servant, to protect Karan. Brahma travels with Pushkar to Kashmir and witnesses the brutality and violence against the Kashmiri Pandits. He brings the matter to the Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir , but is suspended for his efforts.

Militant commander Farooq Malik Bitta, a former student of Pushkar, invades Pushkar Nath's house. Karan hides but is eventually found and shot by Bitta. In a horrifying turn of events, Bitta forces Karan's widow, Sharda, to consume rice soaked in Karan's blood as a condition for sparing their lives. After Bitta and his gang depart, Pushkar pleads with his friend Dr. Mahesh Kumar to bring an ambulance to save Karan, but the hospital is taken over by militants who refuse treatment to non-Muslims, leading to Karan's death.

To ensure their safety, Pushkar and his family are taken in by their journalist friend Vishnu Ram, who leads them to Kaul, a Hindu poet with good relations with Muslims. However, Kaul and his son are falsely taken away by militants under the guise of protection. The remaining Pandits leave, only to discover Kaul and his son hanged from trees.

The Kashmiri Pandit refugees from the valley settle in Jammu, living in difficult conditions on meager rations. Brahma is appointed as an advisor to the new Governor of J&K. Pushkar demands the removal of Article 370 and the return of Kashmiri Pandits during the Home Minister's visit to Jammu camps.

In Nadimarg, Sharda is given a government job by Brahma, and the family relocates there. Tragically, militants, including Bitta, disguise themselves as Indian Army soldiers and round up the Pandits. Sharda resists, and in a horrifying act, she is brutally murdered. Her son Shiva and the remaining Pandits are shot and buried in a mass grave. Pushkar is spared to bear witness to the horrific events.

In the present day, Sharda's younger son Krishna, who was raised by Pushkar, believes his parents died in an accident. While studying at ANU, Krishna is influenced by Professor Radhika Menon, who supports Kashmiri separatism. Pushkar's friends Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh, and Police Officer Hari Narain recall the events in Kashmir as a ""genocide.""

Krishna enters the student elections at ANU and, influenced by Professor Menon, blames the Government of India for the Kashmir issue, angering Pushkar. After Pushkar's death, Krishna fulfills his last wish by scattering his ashes in their ancestral home in Kashmir. Professor Menon suggests that Krishna record footage in Kashmir to expose the government's alleged atrocities. During this visit, Krishna confronts Bitta, who claims to be a non-violent leader, and blames the Indian Army for the deaths of Krishna's family members. When Krishna questions Brahma, he provides newspaper cuttings collected by Pushkar, showing that militants, disguised as Indian Army soldiers, were responsible for these atrocities.

Krishna returns to Delhi and delivers a powerful speech during the university presidential elections, sharing the history of Kashmir and the plight of his family and other Kashmiri Hindu victims, which initially shocks and outrages some, but eventually resonates with many students in the audience.",['Drama'],"A heart-wrenching tale that captures the pain, suffering, and struggle of the Kashmiri Pandit community in 1990 and leads Krishna, a young college student, to set out on a quest to uncover the truth.","Shikara,Hindutva,Halahal,Goliyon Ki Rasleela Ram-Leela,Ram Setu,Shershaah"

P. J. Abdul Kalam, one of his team members from a major injury during an experiment. In 1969, he is accepted into Princeton University in the US.Nambi successfully completes his MSE program in chemical rocket propulsion under professor Luigi Crocco who recommends him for the NASA fellowship. However, after a brief stint at NASA with Barry Amaldev, he is offered a generous paycheck and other allowances. He rejects it and returns to India so that he may make use of his talents at ISRO. Subsequently, he also manages to get 400 million pounds of equipment from Scotland for free. However, after the suspicious death of Vikram Sarabhai, he did not have adequate support from ISRO or funds from the Indian government to continue his research.At this point, Nambi strikes a deal with the French who need skilled scientists to help them build their own liquid fuel engine. He then moves to France with his colleagues, hoping to learn from France's advanced technology so that they may recreate it back in India. Unbeknownst to the French, Nambi and his 52 colleagues have learnt French before their journey but pretend to not understand them. After being kept out of their major discussions, Nambi's team tries to find a way to gain access to these meetings and test data. It is then that they discover that the French engine is faulty. Nambi uses this opportunity to gain access to the required data in exchange for fixing the engine. The team then returns to India and start working on building their own engine on liquid fuels. However, due to a lack of resources, it takes 8 more years to complete. They test the engine at the same testing facility in France - it goes above the 135-pressure mark and goes all the way to 180. Successful in his plans, Nambi returns to India after naming the engine VIKAS after Vikram Sarabhai, his mentor.Nambi's focus is now on cryogenic engines which he believes will make India competent to participate in the world satellite market.

After being hospitalized due to his injuries, Nambi is met by CBI official P. M. Nair, who thoroughly investigates the matter. Nair brings Mariam and her friend, along with a few others into the room. Mariam and her friend reveal that the Kerala police officer in charge of the investigation, Gopal, tortured and threatened them and made them falsely incriminate Nambi, whom they have never met before. They also apologize to Nambi for ruining his reputation and causing pain to him and his family. Nair also figures out that all the accused in this case were members of ISRO's cryogenic wing, and concludes that it was a huge ploy by some powerful parties to hinder India's progress in the cryogenic sector.Months later, Nambi receives bail and returns to his house to find his family members traumatized by the way they were treated by others. Nambi's wife Meena is in need of psychiatric help and the rest of his family are still shunned by society.

15732324,OMG 2,Comedy Drama Lord school case messenger son sex education court family masturbating times,Comedy Drama play unhappy civilian court mandate comprehensive education schools dramatic amusing courtroom,"Naga Sadhus and other devotees are going to attend the 4 A.M. morning ""Bhasm Aarti"" of Lord Mahakaal at the Mahakaal Temple. Among the devotees is Kanti Sharan Mudgal  who is a staunch devotee of Lord Shiva and owns a shop just outside the temple. He finds a stranger's bag laying there and decides to keep it to return it later.
Indumati  is Kanti's wife and daughter Damyanti.One day, Kanti is called to the hospital as his son Vivek  is brought there by a friend. The doctor  tells Kanti that Vivek was up all-night masturbating continuously until he fainted and consumed multiple Viagra tablets. Kanti becomes concerned and is about to scold his son, until the doctor tells him to deal with the matter sensitively as kids get very guilty about masturbation. Kanti later asks Vivek's friend what exactly happened, and he says that Vivek was bullied and told by some boys that the size of his penis is small, and masturbating will increase it.
Vivek started to believe this and started masturbating excessively. The biology teacher at the school refused to answer questions related to this topic, which led Vivek to reach shady people on the streets for medication and drugs to increase his size. He became self-conscious, insecure, depressed, and eventually fainted due to excessive masturbation.Kanti tries to be soft and caring with him, until they're both called to the school Chairman's office the next day. They are told by Principal Atal Nath Maheshwari  that there's a video going around of Vivek masturbating in the school washroom and this is affecting the school's image, and so Vivek is rusticated from the school on grounds of obscenity. Kanti's close friend, Pandey Ji  a rich priest at the Mahakaal Temple, advises him to leave town and not be associated with him anymore as it tarnishes his religious image.The video eventually reaches Kanti's wife and daughter and their entire neighborhood. They start getting shamed by everyone around them.Absolutely devastated, Kanti prays to Lord Shiva for help for his family, when a divine power in the Mahakaal temple is activated and a messenger sent by Lord Shiva  comes out of the river.After a police complaint against Vivek for trying to murder his bully, the messenger meets Vivek and Kanti at the police station, saying he's there to lodge a complaint of his missing bag. He overhears the conversation as everyone is scolding Vivek and comforts his anxiety. He pats Vivek's head and asks him not to worry as ""Lord Mahakaal has his hand on him"". As he leaves the police station, a decorated white bull follows him, signifying Nandi.Vivek tries to commit suicide twice but is saved by the messenger. He meets Kanti at the railway station as they're about to leave town and tells him that his son did nothing wrong by giving the example of a breastfeeding mother to prove the point that not everything done in privacy is wrong or obscene. He says that Vivek doing it inside the school is also the school's fault for not educating him properly and Kanti's fault for not teaching him about these things properly. He advises Kanti to file a case against the school and the medical practitioners. Kanti listens, apologizes to a sleeping Vivek and cancels the plan of leaving town.He files a case against the school, the chemists, the doctor, and himself, and demands small offerings of money to Lord Mahakaal in return along with an apology. While he's confused about how to keep his point forward in court, the stranger's bag that he kept at his house, suddenly falls down and he finds some religious books and sculptures inside it. No lawyer would take Kanti's case, so Kanti decides to defend himself in court.
Kanti keeps the point in court that the Sanatan Dharma was always inclusive of conversations on sex and quotes multiple books to prove this. He also shows the intimate human art carvings on the walls of Ellora, Ajanta, and Khajuraho temples, and gets his case accepted. Pandey Ji asks Kanti to leave his given house and shop as this case will tarnish their image. Kanti vacates the house, believing in Lord Shiva all along.The case continues and the opposition lawyer, Kamini Maheshwari  who's associated with the school , says that Kanti is doing all this just to cover up his son's vulgar and obscene act. Kanti continues his argument by saying that there's nothing ""vulgar"" about these conversations and if the school had included sex education in their courses, his son wouldn't have been so misinformed.Kamini turns to dirty tricks when she threatens to summon Kanti's whole family to court and show their humiliation publicly.
Kanti's family is questioned by Kamini, to which they give well educated answers. The messenger randomly appears in front of Kanti on random occasions and gives him indirect advise on how to continue the case. When Kamini alleges that Kanti has taught his family to answer in these structured ways, Kanti says that they'd all answer the same way if the schools taught them about it.Kamini calls a sex worker in the court, whose son studies in the same school, to prove a point that the school is very inclusive and noble. Kanti is left speechless until the messenger feeds into his mind that he needs to put questions forward to win. In the next hearing, Kanti asks the prostitute if she ever enjoys her work with any of the men who come to her, to which she says no and claims that those men don't know anything about a woman's body and how to treat it with respect. Kanti says that if the schools taught sex education to young boys, they'd know how to respect a woman's body. He then asks the prostitute if she wants to see her son as one of those uneducated men or a man who knows about the woman's body and how to treat it with respect. She's left speechless.He bows down to the prostitute, calling her a brave mother and teacher who is willing to put everything on the line for her son's education.The case continues with the messenger's indirect secret help, as Kanti points out the issues of pornography, sexual abuse, good touch, bad touch, rape, misinformation in teens, false drugs sold by those chemists, unawareness in the youth related to sexual matters, and the importance of sex education. Kanti makes the case that young children would not be misguided if the school imparts proper sex education.
Various people stand in support of him, while some against him, largely including religious leaders saying he's spreading vulgarity in the name of religion and masturbation is a sin. Dozens of cases are filed against Kanti and he knows that his entire life will be wasted fighting these cases.He's then offered a big sum of money  by the school chairman  for taking his case back. Kanti falls into the emotional trap of his son's future and signs the check. As he's going home reconsidering his decision, he gets into an accident and seemingly dies, until he's visited by the messenger in the hospital. The messenger criticizes his decision of signing the check and reveals himself to be sent by the divine Lord Shiva himself. He shows Kanti that his efforts have come to light as Pandey Ji's daughter tells her family about the sexual abuse she's been going through, all thanks to Kanti's case being shown on TV. Kanti realizes his mistake, is reincarnated, and taken to the court by the messenger in a Lamborghini.At the hearing, Vivek arrives for the first time and proves through his research that the Britishers ruined India's education system, a system which was inclusive of sex education in the ancient times. A lot of teens from the crowd come forward saying they masturbate too and it's not a sin, including the Judge's own son. Kanti wins the case as the education board is ordered to make sex education compulsory and payment be given to Kanti so he can offer it to Lord Mahakaal.Kanti introduces his family to the messenger as ""the doctor who treated me in the hospital"". He offers all the money in the messenger's hands instead of the temple. The messenger asks Vivek to keep the lost bag with him, with the cultural and religious knowledge inside it. He then says that he has another patient to attend to and drives away in his car. Kanti looks up in the sky with joined hands and a smile on his face.","['Comedy', 'Drama']",An unhappy civilian asks the court to mandate comprehensive education in schools in a dramatic yet amusing courtroom play.,"Rowdy Rathore,1920 London,Drishyam,Singham,Jayeshbhai Jordaar,Khoobsurat"

She is the symbol of unlimited gold  and grain  and the earth is her womb. When the universe was created, she gave birth to 160 million gods. Hastar, her first and most beloved offspring, was greedy for all her gold and food. Hastar managed to acquire the gold from the goddess but the other gods attacked him just as he was about to acquire her food. Then, the goddess saved him on the condition that he could never be worshipped and would be forgotten by history. For years, Hastar slumbered inside his mother's womb. However, the residents of Tumbbad, where Hastar has been trapped in his mother's womb, defy this ancient taboo and build a temple dedicated to Hastar. This earns the ire of the gods and they curse the village, causing an incessant downpour of rain over it.

In 1918, in Tumbbad, Vinayak's mother and the mistress of the local lord  meet him at his mansion. This includes offering him sexual services in the hope of acquiring a single gold coin kept with the Hastar idol. Meanwhile, at their home, Vinayak and his younger brother Sadashiv worry about having to feed the monstrous old woman, Sarkar's ancestor, chained up in a separate room. The Sarkar later dies, and the mother proposes leaving Tumbbad for Pune. Vinayak insists on finding the treasure that is rumoured to be hidden somewhere in the mansion. Sadashiv gets badly hurt after falling from a tree, forcing his mother to take him for help. She tells Vinayak he will have to feed the old woman that night. She also warns him that if the old woman wakes up, he should invoke the name of ""Hastar"" to make her sleep. Meanwhile, Sadashiv dies on the way to the doctor.

The mother directs her carriage driver to Sarkar's mansion where she retrieves the gold coin. As Vinayak tries to feed her, the monstrous and hungry old woman attacks and shackles him to eat him. Vinayak invokes Hastar's name, causing her to fall into slumber. His mother returns, and the next day she and Vinayak leave Tumbbad for Pune. She forces Vinayak to promise never to return to Tumbbad, despite his protests to stay and search for the treasure.

Fifteen years pass and Vinayak grows up. Desperate to escape his life of poverty, Vinayak returns to Tumbbad. The old woman, with now a tree growing out of her body, warns him he will be cursed to become immortal and turned into a monster like her if he touches the treasure i.e. Hastar. She explains that a well leads to the goddess' womb where Hastar dwells, in exchange for ending her prolonged suffering. Vinayak keeps his promise and sets her on fire, thus killing her. Although Hastar stole the goddess's gold, he was unable to acquire her grain. Therefore, being hungry for years, he desires flour. Vinayak physically trains himself to climb up and down a long rope and makes dolls out of dough to lure Hastar inside the goddess's womb. While he is distracted by the food, Vinayak swipes at Hastar's loincloth containing the gold. Vinayak regularly repeats the procedure to steal dropped coins. He offers his first gold coin to the opium merchant Raghav to pay off a debt. Each time he needs more money, Vinayak returns to Tumbbad to steal from Hastar.

Raghav openly wonders about the treasure rumoured to exist in the Tumbbad mansion while also questioning why Vinayak can only retrieve a few coins at a time. Vinayak and his wife give birth to their son Pandurang. When Sergeant Cooper gives him only two days to come through with the money, Raghav sells his widowed daughter-in-law to Vinayak as a mistress, who tells Vinayak of Raghav's plans to visit Tumbbad to help himself to the treasure in exchange for money. Vinayak is then shown following Raghav to the Tumbbad mansion where he tricks him into descending into the goddess' womb where Hastar viciously attacks Raghav and turns him into a monster, conjoining him into the walls of the womb. Vinayak burns Raghav alive to end his suffering.

In 1947, Vinayak takes Pandurang to the mansion to train him for the same purpose and is told not to bring the dough doll down. But he secretly brings a dough doll and Hastar unexpectedly attacks. They barely manage to escape and Vinayak chides his son for nearly getting them touched. Pandurang suggests stealing Hastar's loincloth and they make dozens of dough dolls to distract Hastar. However, the two of them become trapped inside the womb when multiple clones of Hastar appear, one for each doll they possess. With no hope of escaping, Vinayak ties the dolls to his body to act as bait, to allow his son to return safely. Once the coast is clear, Pandurang climbs back to the surface to see his father being mutated into a monster outside the well. Vinayak presents him with the stolen loincloth that he stole from Hastar, but Pandurang refuses to take it. Sobbing at seeing what his father turned into, Pandurang reluctantly sets Vinayak on fire and leaves.","['Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Horror', 'Thriller']",A mythological story about a goddess who created the entire universe.

15501640,Drishyam 2,Crime Drama Mystery Thriller police family remains station DNA murder hero reveals script judge film discloses son death wife,Crime Drama Mystery Thriller family gripping tale investigation threatened time protect,"On the night of 3 October 2014, a man named David Braganza flees from authorities for murder. While hiding behind a police station that is under construction, he sees Vijay emerging from it. David later attempts to escape town with his wife and son but gets arrested.Seven years later, Vijay, Nandini, Anju, and Anu are living contentedly. Vijay is now a prosperous businessman who owns a movie theatre and still operates a cable company. He aspires to make a film of his own and is in frequent contact with screenwriter Murad Ali to develop the script. Anju, on the other hand, is a PTSD patient and has recurring episodes of epilepsy, as a result of her involvement in Sam's death. Jealous of the family's rise in wealth, a number of locals have resorted to spreading rumors about Anju being in a relationship with Sam, much to Nandini's distress. Her only confidante is her friendly neighbor, Jenny, who is often abused by her alcoholic husband, Shiv.On Sam's death anniversary, Vijay has an encounter with Sam's father Mahesh, who vainly begs him to disclose the location of his son's remains. Meanwhile, Nandini spends more time with Jenny and inadvertently discloses that Anju killed Sam. Unknown to her, Jenny and Shiv are married undercover cops, assigned by Inspector-general of police Tarun Ahlawat, who is a close friend and colleague of Meera.At the same time, David is released from prison. After struggling to reconcile with his now-estranged wife, he yearns to find employment. While coming to know that Vijay's case is still ongoing, he recalls the latter's presence at the then-under-construction police station and realizes that Vijay was indeed complicit in the murder. He tips Tarun, who summons Meera and Mahesh from London. After the trio bribes him, David divulges what he saw, leading to the newly-built police station being excavated. The police eventually find a skeleton. Vijay, having noticed this through his CCTV cameras which he had installed around the police station, seemingly gives up.Tarun summons Vijay's for questioning. While Vijay, Nandini, Anu, and Anju manage to maintain their alibi; Meera reveals a voice recording of Nandini's earlier confession to Jenny; the police bugged the family residence earlier, exposing the family. Gaitonde thrashes Vijay's family, causing Anju to have one of her fits. A distraught Vijay falsely confesses that he killed Sam. With the police satisfied, the family are let go, and Vijay gets arrested and placed on trial for Sam's murder, although Meera isn't satisfied and demands that Vijay's family be punished as well.Having learnt of Vijay's arrest, Murad visits Tarun, Meera, and Mahesh. He reveals that during one of his encounters with Vijay, the latter had fabricated a script for a future crime thriller, loosely based on Sam's murder. He says that the script had been turned into a novel titled Drishyam, although it was published under Murad's name for copyright protection. Vijay pleads not guilty, with his lawyer claiming that the police used Drishyam's plot as a means to frame him. Furthermore, the judge reveals that the DNA tests conducted on the skeleton do not match Sam's DNA, much to everyone's shock. Murad reveals that Vijay had fabricated an alternate climax for his film in which the hero, knowing his initial plan might fail, would procure the remains of another person of the same age and sex who had died of similar injuries to those of the villain, by befriending the gravedigger at the local cemetery. The hero would keep the skeletal remains with him for three years before befriending the security guard of the district medical college morgue under the pretext of promising him a role in his film. The same night they were excavated from the police station and arrived at the morgue, the hero would swap the bodies before the DNA analysis takes place.Vijay is released on bail due to a lack of evidence, and the police are prohibited from investigating the family. The judge calls Tarun to his chambers and tells him to end all investigations against Vijay and his family, as he believes both families deserve justice, but the legal system is unable to provide it to them. The judge also tells him that such cases are not new to the system. Outside the courthouse, Murad discloses to Meera and Mahesh that Vijay's alternative climax had a twist in which the hero would hand over the villain's cremated remains to the bereaved parents. Simultaneously, Vijay has Sam's cremated remains anonymously handed over to Meera and Mahesh.Mahesh immerses Sam's remains and persuades Meera to let go of her enmity towards Vijay, as he believes they have found closure and believes Vijay would do anything to protect his family. Vijay, who was watching from afar, solemnly leaves.","['Crime', 'Drama', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']",A gripping tale of an investigation and a family which is threatened by it.

1954470,Gangs of Wasseypur,Action Comedy Crime Drama Thriller Defin Sult Durg Iql lly business mily Asg tion loc nish son,Action Comedy Crime Drama Thriller generations leads spanning clash expulsion ignites deadly blood feud,"Prologue
In January 2004 , a gang of heavily armed men scour and finally narrow down on a house in Wasseypur. They surround the house and unleash a wave of bullets and grenades on it with the intention of killing the family inside it. After heavy firing on the house, they retreat from the crime scene in a vehicle, convinced they have killed everyone within. The leader of the gang then calls J.P. Singh on his cell phone and reports that the family has been successfully executed but he is double crossed by JP Singh as a fire fight erupts between them and a police check post blocking their escape route. The scene cuts abruptly for a prologue by the narrator, Nasir. The whole scene is then revealed in the sequel.Introduction of Wasseypur and Dhanbad
Nasir's narration describes the history and nature of Wasseypur. During the British Raj, Wasseypur and Dhanbad were located in the Bengal region. After India gained its independence in 1947, they were carved out of Bengal and redistricted into the state of Bihar in 1956. In 2000, Wasseypur and Dhanbad were redistricted for a second time into the newly formed state of Jharkhand where they remain. The village has been historically dominated by the Qureshi Muslims, a sub-caste of animal butchers who are feared by the non-Qureshi Muslims living there and Dhanbad by extension.During British colonial rule, the British had seized the farm lands of Dhanbad for coal which began the business of coal mining in Dhanbad. The region was a hotbed of the local faceless robber Sultana Qureshi who robbed British trains in the night and thus held some patriotic value for the locals.1940s
In 1941 , Shahid Khan , a Pathan, takes advantage of the mysteriousness of the faceless robber Sultana, a Qureshi, by impersonating his identity to rob British ferry trains. The Qureshi clans eventually find out and order the banishment of Shahid Khan and his family from Wasseypur. They settle down in Dhanbad where Shahid begins work as a laborer in a coal mine. He is unable to be at his wife's side during childbirth, and she dies. The enraged Shahid kills the coal mine's muscleman who had denied him leave on that day. In 1947, independent India begins to assert its authority over itself. The British coal mines are sold to Indian industrialists and Ramadhir Singh  receives a few coal mines in the Dhanbad region. He hires Shahid Khan as the new muscleman of one of the coal mines. Shahid terrorizes the local population to seize their lands and extract compliance.On a rainy day, Ramadhir Singh overhears Shahid's ambitions of taking over the coal mines from him. Singh tricks Shahid into traveling to Varanasi for business but instead has him murdered by an assassin named Yadav Ji . Nasir , Shahid's cousin, finds Ramadhir's umbrella with his initials near the door and concludes that Ramadhir eavesdropped on their conversation. He flees from the house with Shahid's son Sardar in the nick of time as Ehsaan Qureshi , another associate of Ramadhir Singh and a member of the Wasseypur Qureshi clan, shows up to kill them but is too late. An unsuccessful Ehsaan lies to Singh that Shahid's family has been murdered, burnt, and buried. Under the care of Nasir, Sardar grows up along with Nasir's nephew Asgar . Sardar learns the truth about his father's death, upon which he shaves his head and vows not to grow his hair until he has avenged his father's murder.Early and Mid 1970s
In 1972 , the coal mines are nationalized. A mature Sardar Khan  and his kin start hijacking Ramadhir's coal trucks mid-transit. Ramadhir Singh suspects S.P. Sinha, a Coal India official, to be behind the hijackings and has him murdered. After Sinha's murder, Ramadhir's reputation for ruthlessness grows, and he becomes feared in Dhanbad.Sardar marries Nagma Khatoon . The pregnant Khatoon confronts Sardar Khan and a prostitute inside a brothel and chases him away. Later, Nagma gives birth to Danish Khan but gets pregnant immediately afterwards. Unable to have sex with a pregnant Nagma, Sardar confesses his sexual frustrations with his kin. At dinner, Nagma gives her consent to Sardar to sleep with other women but with the condition that he won't bring them home or dishonor the family name.Sardar, Asgar and Nasir start working for J.P. Singh , Ramadhir Singh's son. They misuse their employment by secretly selling the company petrol in the black market. Later, they rob a petrol pump and a train bogey belonging to the Singh family. They usurp Singh's land, which forces the two families to confront each other for talks. The meeting ends in a scuffle, but Ramadhir Singh realizes that Sardar Khan is in fact the son of Shahid Khan who he had murdered in the late 1940s. Sardar and Asgar are jailed for assaulting J.P. Singh during the meeting.Early 1980s
In 1979 , Sardar and Asgar escape from jail. While hiding in Wasseypur, Sardar marries a Bengali Hindu woman named Durga . Asgar informs Nagma that Sardar has taken a second wife, leaving Nagma helpless. Meanwhile, Wasseypur has merged with Dhanbad and the Qureshi clan continues to terrorize the non-Qureshi Muslims. The locals then approach Sardar Khan for help as he was well known for standing up to Ramadhir Singh. During Muharram, both Shias and Sunnis are out mourning, including the Qureshi clan. Sardar uses the opportunity to launch a major bomb attack on many Qureshi shops and houses. When word spreads about Sardar's raids, his reputation grows and he commands more fear than the Qureshi clan.Eventually, Sardar returns home to Nagma and she gets pregnant again. Sardar tries to initiate sex with a pregnant Nagma but she refuses, which prompts an angry Sardar to leave. He goes to stay with his second wife, Durga, and she gives birth to his son, Definite. Ramadhir Singh, noticing that Sardar has abandoned his first family, tries to reach out to Nagma through Danish by giving him money. An enraged Nagma beats Danish for taking the money while she breaks down in front of Nasir. A thirsty Faizal wakes up in the middle of the night to find Nagma and Nasir about to have sex. Angry, he storms out of the house and becomes a stoner, permanently seen with his cannabis. Nasir reveals that the desires were never consummated, but Faizal and Nasir never see eye to eye again.Mid and Late 1980s
Sensing Sardar's increasing clout, Ramadhir calls his old associate Ehsaan Qureshi who brokers a meeting between Sultan Qureshi, his nephew and Ramadhir Singh where the two decide to become allies against their common enemy, Sardar. Sultan asks Ramadhir for modern automatic weapons which the latter promises to give.1990s
Sardar becomes the most feared man in Wasseypur and shifts his business to stealing iron ore. Danish Khan  joins the family business. A failed attack from Sultan Qureshi leaves Danish with a minor injury and causes reconciliation between Sardar and Nagma. Sardar finds Ramadhir and warns him of terrible consequences if anything ever happens to his family.A mature Faizal  is seriously affected by Bollywood movies as he starts behaving, talking and dressing like Bollywood characters. Sardar sends Faizal to Varanasi to buy guns, but Faizal is caught by the police and jailed. Upon release, he kills the gun seller Yadav, who unbeknownst to Faizal was the nameless assassin who had killed Shahid Khan  and who had implicated Faizal to police earlier. Meanwhile, Sardar seizes a lake belonging to a local temple and charges commission on fish sellers who make a catch in that lake. An uneasy peace is maintained between the Qureshi and Khan families when Danish Khan marries Shama Parveen, the sister of Sultan Qureshi. At the same time, Faizal begins romancing Mohsina Hamid , another kin of Sultan.Epilogue
Faizal reveals to his friend, Faizlu that his father Sardar would be travelling without security the next day. Unbeknownst to Faizal, Faizlu is actually an ally of Sultan. Late that night, while Faizal is still asleep, Faizlu calls up the Qureshis and tells them that Sardar's bodyguards wouldn't be with him the next day. The next morning, Sardar leaves home alone and reaches Durga's house where he gives her her expense allowance. Once Sardar leaves, Durga also calls up the Qureshis and tells them that he has just left her house. The Qureshi men follow Sardar's car, and when the latter stops at a petrol pump to refuel they start shooting as Sardar ducks in the car for cover. The Qureshi men put several close rounds through the car window ensuring a precise and unmistakable hit, after which they escape. A shocked Sardar opens the car door and stands up to reveal multiple bullet wounds, with one bullet embedded in his head. He steps out with his gun drawn to stop a cycle ferry on which he eventually collapses to his death.The second film resumes with the killing of Sardar Khan. Danish, his elder son Danish instantly kills the lone captured killer and vows to kill rest of the three killers. Sultan realizing the danger kills Danish. It is now up to Faizal to exact revenge. No one in the family thinks that Faizal would be able to do that since most of the time he is seen smoking weed, but he promises his mother that he would.Faizal stays low and waits for right opportunity. When his friend Fazlu , wins local election Faizal meets him on pretext of congratulating him and kills him. This establishes that Faizal can indeed lead his father's business.Meanwhile Faizal marries his sweetheart Mohsina. Wasseypur is no more the town that was once consumed by the raging war between Sardar Khan and Ramadhir Singh. It has spawned a new generation of money squandering lobbyists, turning into foolhardy gangs overnight. A small time goon Shamshad Alam has his own transport business. He joins hands with Faizal Khan in his steel business. The deal is that Shamshad would fill Faizal's coffers with his astute knowledge of his scrap business and support Faizal's business with his transport business. Simultaneously Faizal makes truce with Ramadhir Singh. According to their agreement, Ramadhir would provide his political support to Faizal's business in Wasseypur region on condition he would not extract revenge of his kin. Although he is sympathetic with Sultan initially, he informs Sultan of the agreement and that he would be of little help to him. Ramadhir meanwhile is losing his faith in his son's  ability to run his empire and J.P. often finds himself in line of fire for his inability. This results in waning of J.P.'s prominence and influence.Faizal's half brother  Definate is turning out to be deadly as well as very cunning teenager. After death of Sardar Khan his mother  works as a cook at Ramadhir Singh's place and hence Ramadhir Singh thinks he has influence over Definate. Faizal's younger brother Perpendicular a school going teenager, is creating a menace in locality by looting shops in broad daylight. Although courageous like his father, he is stupid. Harassed with his antics, local shopkeepers Hire Sultan to assassinate Perpendicular. Shamshad on the other hand is keeping Faizal in dark about the transactions and pocketing some part of the profit for himself. One fine day his scheme is exposed and he is tensed. He decides to partner with Ramadhir Singh to save his skin. Faizal is arrested through Shamshad and at same-time Sultan kills Perpendicular. Definite feels that this is the right time to step into shoes of Faizal and before Shamshad claims this position he would have to kill him. Definate's gun jams right in the middle of the assassination attempt and he has to run for his life. Unfortunately he runs into bogey full of army personnel and sent to same jail, where he meets Faizal.Ramadhir advises Shamshad to bail Definate out of the jail and then instigate him against his own brother for his empire. Faizal realizes the plan and cautions Definate before he leaves the jail. Definate straight away bombs Shamshad's office in which Shamshad is badly injured and loses his leg. In rage, Sultan enters Faizal's house & upon finding none else, kills his own sister Shama Parveen. Faizal vows revenge. Sultan is cautioned by JP when Faizal is about to be released from jail and advises him to hit him before Faizal hits him. So Sultan along with his gang raids the house of Faizal and the first scene of part 1 is shown where Sultan is fiercely pounding Faizal's home with bombs and bullets. It is revealed that Faizal and his entire family has a lucky escape. JP arranges another attack in which Ashgar & Nagma are killed. Later Sultan is double crossed by JP and has run into hiding. Definate along with Faizal's gang track him down and kill him. On advice of Faizal, Definate surrenders and is jailed.Meanwhile Iqlakh an educated man enters Faizal's life.

J.P. meanwhile has other plans and wants to double cross his father, of whom he is tired of with his insulting slurs.Definate goes straight to Faizal and informs him of the plan. As per the plan on the polling day Faizal is to be killed by Iqlakh and if he misses Definate has to take the hit. On the D-day Iqlakh leads Faizal to an isolated place for the hit and Definate arrives late on the scene. Here Definate double crosses Iqlakh and kills him. Later Faizal & Definate take an ambulance with large cache of weapons and heads towards the hospital where Shamshad is admitted and Ramadhir is there to hatch his new plan. A ruthless blood bath takes place in the hospital between gangs of Faizal, Ramadhir and the police.Ramadhir is easily outclassed by Faizal.

He gets stranded in Rajasthan as his spaceship's remote control device gets stolen by a villager. The alien chases the man in an attempt to retrieve his device back but only manages to take the radio recorder of the thief. He later learns that roaming naked on Earth isn't deemed natural. Thus, he begins stealing clothes and money from couples having sex in cars with open windows.The alien befriends Bhairon Singh  who assumes the alien is simply a person suffering a memory loss. Singh helps the alien get accustomed to the village. The alien has the ability to transfer a person's memory to his own brain by holding that person's hands and, hence, he attempts to learn the local language through this technique. However, he finds out that just grabbing the hands of a stranger, whether male or female, is not accepted, and since he does not speak the language yet, he is unable to explain what he wants. Singh, who interprets this alien's behavior as sexual interest, takes him to a brothel. Over there, the alien holds a prostitute's hand for several hours, and thus learns the language.The alien travels to Delhi as he is informed that it is most likely the place where his stolen device would be sold. Due to his strange behaviour, the people in the city assume him to be tipsy and refer to him as PK. Delhi turns out to be a very large city, and people tell him that only God can help him find the device. However, PK is confused by the various religions and their own different understandings of God. PK later discovers that a godman, Tapasvi Maharaj , has his device.

Jaggu, very disappointed, leaves, discarding the letter by leaving it there on a chair.Later, back in India, Jaggu sees PK distributing leaflets about a missing God. As a reporter, she is interested in this strange man, and makes contact. PK tells her the whole story. Jaggu convinces her channel head  to make a TV show with PK, exposing Tapasvi. People in masses get connected to the show and open their eyes against the fake godmen. Tapasvi comes to the studio for a confrontation with PK. In the same TV show, Tapasvi brings up Jaggu´s personal matter of her bad experience with Sarfaraz to prove a point. Due to PK's request, Jaggu reluctantly tries to contact Sarfaraz which leads her to call the Pakistan Embassy in Belgium. The embassy tells Jaggu that Sarfaraz calls them daily to inquire whether Jaggu has called. It turns out that the message in Bruges was a case of mistaken identity by the letter delivery boy. After Jaggu left the town hall, Sarfaraz had arrived and assumed the message was from Jaggu, for him. The misunderstanding between them gets cleared. After hearing this, Tapasvi reluctantly gives PK his device back.In this whole process, PK falls in love with Jaggu but chooses not to tell her as she loves Sarfaraz. Recording tapes with her voice in them, he fills his suitcases with batteries to be constantly able to hear them on his home planet. While departing, he lies to Jaggu regarding the content of the tapes. Jaggu, having found out the true content of the tapes, painfully keeps quiet.Jaggu later publishes a book about PK and, at a book reading, claims that she misses him deeply due to the memories he has left her with and the impact he had made on her life.The movie ends with PK coming back on Earth a year later for more research with another alien .","['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Sci-Fi']",An alien on Earth loses the only device he can use to communicate with his spaceship.

4934950,Talvar,Crime Drama Mystery Thriller police case parents murders Director Joint function led investigation assistant team chief report film,Crime Drama Mystery Thriller homicide experienced investigator confronts conflicting theories perpetrators violent double,"The film starts off with an introduction of Joint Director Ashwin Kumar at the annual function of India's premier police investigating agency, the Central Department of Investigation . At the function , his senior officers hand him over a double murder case. The film then goes into a flashback of events leading to the murders.On the night of 15-16 March 2008, Shruti Tandon , a 14-year girl is found dead at her home in Sameer Vihar of Noida, by her parents Ramesh  and Nutan . The local policemen, led by Inspector Dhaniram  are incompetent, and do not know the basics of criminal investigation. Initially, they seek the missing servant Khempal. However, later, Khempal's decomposed body is found on the terrace of the building in which the Tandons live. The police question Khempal's close friend and Tandons' assistant Kanhaiya. Kanhaiya tells the police that Ramesh Tandon might have been involved in an extra-marital affair, and Khempal might have been involved in a relationship with Shruti. The police start suspecting the Tandons, and after sometime, declare the murders as a clear case of honour killing. On 25 March, the Noida police arrest Ramesh Tandon for the two murders. The police chief organizes a press conference in which he declares that Ramesh murdered Shruti and Khempal after finding them in a compromising position. This character assassination of Shruti leads to public outrage, and the case is handed over to the Central Department of Investigation , the country's elite investigating police agency.The CDI team is led by Joint Director Ashwin Kumar  and ACP Vedant . Kumar holds contempt for the sloppy first responders who botched the initial crime-scene investigation. He believes the parents to be innocent, and methodically builds a case against the father's resentful assistant. His team uses narco tests, attempting to prove that the assistant and his two accomplices committed the murders. On 22 June 2008, he officially exonerates the parents, and Ramesh Tandon is released from the jail. The narrative also briefly discusses the dissolution of Kumar's marriage with Reema .Just as Ashwin Kumar is about to conclude his investigation, his senior officer retires and a new CDI chief takes over. ACP Vedant, in his greed to get a promotion, starts working against Kumar. This leads to an altercation between the two officers, resulting in Kumar's suspension. On 9 July 2008, CDI hands over the case to a new probe team led by Kumar's former boss Paul , who concludes that the parents committed the murders. In the final act, rival camps , with opposing hypotheses, make their cases before the CDI chief. On 20 February 2011, CDI files a closure report in Ghaziabad court, naming parents as the prime suspects, but states that the evidence is insufficient to initiate prosecution. On 15 March, the Tandons file a protest plea opposing CDI's report. On 25 March, the judge rejects the closure report and makes the parents an accused in the case. The trial begins on 8 June 2012, and the Tandons are convicted for the murders on 26 November 2013.","['Crime', 'Drama', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']",An experienced investigator confronts several conflicting theories about the perpetrators of a violent double homicide.,"Gumraah,Samrat &amp; Co.,Aakrosh,Raat Akeli Hai,Halahal,Silence...

5571734,Pink,Crime Drama Thriller women RDIN Raunak Raashul Tandon Bedi friends young men police prostitutes apartment filing lawyer man fact,Crime Drama Thriller young crime women implicated retired lawyer steps forward clear,"Three young and affluent boys, Raunak , Vishwajyoti  and Rajveer Singh  rush to the nearest hospital because Rajveer is profusely bleeding from an injury to his head. They nervously refrain from filing a police complaint.On the other side of the same town, three young women - Minal , Falak  and Andrea - hurriedly travel in a taxi to their apartment. They look disoriented, and it is implied that they have something to do with the incident. Minal and her friends are shaken but try to carry on with their normal life.The story revolves around these three young women. They are independent and self-sufficient women living together in Faridabad.Minal goes out for her usual morning run, where she is constantly observed by an old man who lives in her neighbourhood, a man called Deepak . He senses there is something wrong and introduces himself to these women as a reputable lawyer who is in retirement, and they enlist his help in the matter.Eventually, as Deepak had predicted to the women, a series of threats arise from Rajveer's friend Ankit , who pushes for revenge. The threats result in Andrea being stalked and Falak losing her job. They are discouraged by a police officer from filing a complaint stating it would make their daily lives more miserable unless they relocate to another town or city. In reality, the local police are aware that the young men are ""well connected"" and are backed-up by Rajveer's uncle Ranjit, a powerful influential politician from South Delhi.Nevertheless, Minal files a complaint.Immediately, the next day, Minal is kidnapped by Rajveer's friends during her morning run. Deepak witnesses the incident but is unable to help in the heat of the moment even though he notes down the details and number plate of the carMinal is threatened to stop filing complaints, blackmailed and is molested in the moving car and later dropped back home after all the commotion with a serious warning. A few days later, Minal is arrested by police from her apartment, based on a complaint from Rajveer labelling the women as prostitutes and charging Minal with attempted murder.At this point, Deepak says enough is enough and visits Falak and Andrea at their apartment. Soon enough he helps them with the bail procedures and also in representing them in the court to plead their case.In the courtroom, Rajveer's lawyer, Prashant Mehra , presents the following version of events:Rajveer and his friends meet with Minal and her friends at a rock concert. The men invite the women for dinner at a hotel resort, where they have drinks. The women provoke the men, have intimate relations and thereafter demand money, all signs indicating that they are prostitutes. Rajveer refuses to pay and an enraged Minal hits him on the head with a bottle and flees. Prashant's argument focuses on the poor moral character of the women. He pushes the idea that the friendly manner of the women, the fact that they attended a rock concert and the fact that they had drinks with the men indicate that they were prostitutes. Prashant attacks the fact that Minal has family in Delhi but chooses to live alone, Falak is in a relationship with an older man, and Andrea has moved to the city from Northeast India.Contrary to this, Minal and her friends statement: that the men tried to sexually assault them. Minal alleges that Rajveer tried to rape her, and she attacked him with the bottle in self-defense.Deepak's argument focuses on the issue of consent and a woman's right to say no.A series of interesting and chilling courtroom arguments ensues in the following days.Towards the end of the trial, Rajveer becomes enraged and provoked by the reputable and respected lawyer Deepak, revealing the truth by stating that the women ""got what they deserved"".Deepak criticizes the regressed views of the society where women are stereotyped as prostitutes if they come home late, move out of their home, want to be independent, drink and so on, but none of these applies to men.In his closing remarks, Deepak mentions that his client said ""no"". No means no and does not require further explanation. The women are acquitted while Rajveer, Ankit, and Dumpy are charged, with the duration of their sentences pending. Vishwajyoti is let off with a warning.","['Crime', 'Drama', 'Thriller']","When three young women are implicated in a crime, a retired lawyer steps forward to help them clear their names.","Badla,Thank You,My Client&apos;s Wife,No One Killed Jessica,Trahimam,Aakrosh"
10324144,Article 15,Crime Drama Mystery Thriller girls Pradesh Local ficer village caste case ficers Minister men school girls',Crime Drama Mystery Thriller discrimination rural heartlands upright police officer sets crusade violent caste-based crimes,"In the village of Laalgaon in Uttar Pradesh, two Dalit girls are seen trapped in a school bus by some men. Ayan Ranjan, a St. Stephen's College, Delhi graduate and an Indian Police Service officer, is assigned to Laalgaon as the Additional Superintendent of Police and is warmly welcomed by officers Brahmadatt Singh and Kisan Jatav. Ayan encounters various forms of caste discrimination as soon as he arrives in the village, and periodically shares what he observes to his wife, Aditi, over the phone. Local villagers come to Ayan's reception asking the officers to find the missing girls but are turned down. Ayan reunites with his college friend Satyendra Rai, who is also a state government employee, who behaves suspiciously throughout the night.

The next morning, the girls are found hanging from a tree, while a third girl, Pooja, is reported missing. Ayan orders Brahmadatt to file an FIR and to obtain the postmortem report for the deceased girls. The girls' autopsy yields evidence that they were gang raped, but Brahmadatt prevents the release of this information and instead pushes a narrative suggesting that the girls, who were cousins, were lesbians lovers in an incestuous relationship and thus hanged by their fathers in an honor killing. Meanwhile, Jatav and a junior officer are threatened and their vehicle set on fire by followers of Nishad, leader of Bhim Sangharsh Sena , a group of activists within the village who seek speedy justice for the crime. Ayan questions Jatav about this the next day and becomes determined to solve the case.

Gaura, Pooja's sister, informs Ayan that the girls used to work for a local builder named Anshu Naharia, who slapped Pooja after the girls asked for a raise in their salary of 3 rupees. Ayan decides to call Anshu for inquiry, even though Brahmadatt tries to persuade him not to do so, as Anshu is the son of local Minister Ramlal Naharia. During his interrogation, Anshu says that he slapped the girls in order to remind their entire caste about their place in society. Ayan, disgusted by the moral corruption of the village and its police force, posts on the police bulletin board a copy of Article 15 of the Constitution of India, which prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, religion, caste, or birthplace.

Ayan meets with Dr. Malti Ram, a member of a scheduled caste and the assistant coroner who performed the autopsy, and finds out that contrary to her official report, the girls were raped and then murdered. He asks her to go to Lucknow to examine the DNA samples and to contact only him, realizing that local law enforcement is conspiring with Ramlal Naharia to cover up the case. Meanwhile, Mahantji, a Brahmin politician vying for a local election, has formed an alliance with the head of the Laalgaon Dalit community in a show of inter-caste unity, but Nishad sees the display as a disingenuous political ploy and plans to protest it. Ayan tries to persuade Nishad to call off the protest, so he has men to help search for Pooja; Nishad refuses, but allows some of his men to aid Ayan's search.

Ayan soon gets a call from Malti, who confirms that Anshu was the one who gang-raped and murdered the two girls. Ayan gets an arrest warrant for Anshu and raids his house, but Anshu is not present. However, Ayan spots a school bus that was seen by local villagers around the time of the girls' disappearance, and investigates the nearby school , where he finds evidence from the scene of girls' torture and rape. Elsewhere, Anshu is staying under protection from Brahmadatt, who is revealed to be one of the rapists. Brahmadatt kills Anshu to save himself.

Panikar, a high-ranking CBI officer, arrives in Laalgaon and suspends Ayan from the case. Ayan refuses to give up his efforts and tracks down Satyendra, who admits that he was at a party hosted by Anshu the night of the crime, and that he witnessed Anshu, Brahmadatt, and police officer Nihal Singh  rape the girls while severely drunk and later hang their dead bodies. Ayan confronts Nihal, who commits suicide out of remorse.

Jatav arrests Brahmadatt on Ayan's command. Panikar attempts to threaten Ayan into dropping the case, but Ayan reveals he has already submitted all his evidence to the Home Minister, and sharply criticizes the bigotry and injustice against people of lower castes among Indian law enforcement. Ayan then leads other officers through a large swamp in search of Pooja. They emerge on the other side in a jungle where they find a severely dehydrated Pooja hiding inside a pipe. They rescue her, and with her statement, Brahmadutt gets eleven years of imprisonment as punishment. Mahantji wins the election, hands down.","['Crime', 'Drama', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']","In the rural heartlands of India, an upright police officer sets out on a crusade against violent caste-based crimes and discrimination.","Kathal: A Jackfruit Mystery,Singham,Drishyam,Trahimam,Cuttputlli,Raman Raghav 2.0"

In the High Court, senior and talented criminal barrister Tarun Saluja works hard to punch holes in the accuser's claims, while Hiral Gandhi a fervent lawyer fighting her first big case, who was once Saluja's trainee, serve as the prosecutor and defence barrister of the claimed victim. Tarun Saluja goes by his principle Law is a fact, Justice is abstract. & lawyer should not get emotionally involved in the case or get into the debate of what is right or wrong. Tarun Saluja explains Hiral Gandhi that how justice is left out without proper defence. The pursuit of justice is nothing but a career opportunity for the defence lawyer, prosecution & the judges as well. He summaries this with his line "" We're in the business of law, not of Justice"". This is completely contrary to Hiral's attitude who gets passionately involved in her pursuit to deliver justice. For this very reason, she has quit the law firm of Tarun.Tarun in his cross-examination exposes tampering of evidence, lies & facts hidden by key witnesses. It is later clear that Anjali had consensual relation with Rohan which started with the pressure of retaining her job, but with time she got emotionally involved in the relationship. Later when she realises that Rohan is only interested in keeping a physical relationship with her whereas she was expecting him to be her life partner. There is a big argument between the two on this issue. Rohan belittles her & tells her that without him her career is over. Later Rohan throws her out of his second flat where they pursued their relationship. After a couple of days, Anjali apologises to Rohan & they rekindle their relationship. Later in the day, she reports this incident as rape to police.Insisting that it is a case of an affair gone sour, Tarun Saluja points out that the law does not regard consensual physical relations as rape. Hiral Gandhi argues that though a couple may have had a consensual relationship in the past, any subsequent sexual encounter without consent of the girl is rape. The case disputes the legal provisions of the penal code 375 that defines conditions under which a sexual offence can be defined as rape.The judges are put in a tough spot because on one hand, it is clear that Anjali had filed this case to take avenge her humiliation & on the other hand there is a strong public perception that rich & influential people are exploiting the underprivileged people. The two judges deliberate on the case in their chamber. A judgement in favour of Tarun would badly reflect on their credentials however, circumstantial evidence clearly points to fake rape charges. One of the judges peeks from the balcony and see protests against the accused going out of control and it is clear what their judgement would be. The bench while delivering the verdict accepts the merit of the case presented by Tarun however, they give into the public sentiment & strictly go by the book. They uphold the session court judgement which states that since there is no evidence of consent or force for this particular incident, so the statement of the victim is considered as paramount evidence. Later she is invited for dinner by Tarun's family & there he reminds her ""We're in the business of law, not of Justice"" which she now truly understands.","['Crime', 'Drama', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']","A celebrated Bollywood director Rohan Khurana stands accused by a female member of his crew, Anjali Dangle of having raped her at his residence.","Trahimam,Jazbaa,Nail Polish,Article 15,Kaabil,Jolly LLB"

Two years later Vidya Bagchi , a pregnant software engineer, arrives in Kolkata from London during the Durga Puja festivities in search of her missing husband, Arnab Bagchi. A police officer, Satyaki ""Rana"" Sinha , offers to help. Although Vidya claims that Arnab went to Kolkata on an assignment for the National Data Center , initial investigations suggest that no such person was employed by the NDC.Agnes D'mellow, the NDC's head of human resources, suggests to Vidya that her husband resembled former employee Milan Damji , whose file is probably kept in the old NDC office. Before Agnes can provide any further help she is killed by Bob Biswas , an assassin working undercover as a life insurance agent. Vidya and Rana break into the NDC office and find Damji's file, barely escaping an encounter with Bob, who is searching for the same information. Meanwhile, the attempts to obtain Damji's records have attracted the attention of two Intelligence Bureau  officials in Delhi - the chief Bhaskaran K.  and his deputy Khan . Khan arrives in Kolkata and reveals that Damji was a rogue IB agent responsible for the poison-gas attack. In spite of Khan's warnings, Vidya continues her search, fearing that Arnab's resemblance to Damji may have led him into trouble.Vidya and Rana investigate & find that Damji had a rare blood group and had stored blood in a blood bank, which was called for by a nursing home on the night of the Metro station attack. They find the doctor who treated Damji that night, but the doctor is busy is surgery and that night is shot dead by Bob. The duo reach out to an informer who tells them that night there was a meeting between 3 people, Damji, Vijay Verma  & Dinesh . Rana speculates that the meeting was between Vijay and Dinesh, who were exchanging information & was stopped by Damji who killed both Vijay and Dinesh & was himself wounded in the attack. Vidya speculates that Dinesh was about to get a tip about Damji's involvement from Vijay & someone in the IB HQ had tipped Damji about this meeting happening. This indicated that Damji had planned the metro attack at the behest someone high up in the IB hierarchy.The address on Damji's record leads Vidya and Rana to a dilapidated flat. An errand boy from the neighborhood tea stall identifies R. Sridhar, an NDC officer, as a frequent visitor to Damji's flat.

Vidya accidentally shoots Sridhar dead during a scuffle, which upsets Khan, who had wanted him alive.Sridhar's computer data reveals a code, which when deciphered reveals Bhaskaran's phone number. Vidya calls Bhaskaran to tell him that she has retrieved sensitive documents from Sridhar's office. She asks Bhaskaran to help find her husband in exchange for the documents, but Bhaskaran tells her to contact the local police. Vidya soon gets a call from an unknown number however, warning her that she should hand over the documents to the caller if she wishes to see her husband alive. Khan thinks the caller is Milan Damji.Vidya goes to meet Damji, followed by Rana and Khan. Damji cuts the meeting short when Vidya expresses her doubt that he will be able to return her husband in exchange for the sensitive file, and he attempts to leave. Vidya tries to stop him, and in the ensuing struggle Damji draws a gun on her.

She flees into the crowd before the police arrive, leaving a thank-you note for Rana and a pen drive containing data from Sridhar's computer, which leads to Bhaskaran's arrest. Rana concludes that no Vidya or Arnab Bagchi ever existed, and that Vidya had been using the police and the IB to achieve her own ends.Vidya is revealed to be the widow of Arup Basu , an IB officer and Damji's colleague, who was killed in the poison-gas attack. In her mission to avenge his death, Vidya was helped by retired IB officer Pratap Bajpayee , who suspected the involvement of a top IB official.","['Mystery', 'Thriller']","A pregnant woman's search for her missing husband takes her from London to Kolkata, but everyone she questions denies having ever met him.","Kahaani 2,Mrs Undercover,Raat Akeli Hai,Cuttputlli,Bob Biswas,Paharganj"

What's waiting for our protagonist Siya Singh , as she goes about her day collecting genhu and lakdi on her cycle. She is abducted, brutalised for days on end, tied in chains to a bed without food or water as men take turns. Lumps of dried blood on her body attract ants as she lies motionless watching them crawl on the very chain that binds her, just wanting to go home to her mother.

The clinical manner in which Siya is handled after her rape is all the more impactful because it is presented plainly, without any needless flourishes. The grim inevitability to Siya’s quest survives the scripting contrivances in the later portions.

With every plot uptick, first in the form of nationwide media attention, then Siya's perpetrators - one of whom is the brother of a local neta - are nabbed, sent to custody, but are eventually left on bail. Siya decides to fight on with the help of Mahendra , a lawyer and a friend of the family, and after much struggle, a CBI probe is ordered which finds the local neta guilty of raping her too. When Siya refuses to be guilted into marrying one of her rapists and pursues justice, her father is beaten up by local goons and picked up by the cops on false charges of possession of arms. He is killed in police custody and cremated right before the family's eyes in a show of power. Back down or this could be you next. The family is also shot at when they attempt to spread the father’s ashes.Blatant abuse of power - money, political and class - runs through the veins of the film. At every given point, Siya is reminded she is weak. And at the mercy of the influential .Siya’s champions, lawyer brother-in-law , her mother, and aunt are killed in a fake car crash. In slow and chilling detail, Siya loses everything until she is all alone, in a coma at a hospital.

In the climax scene, as Siya, Mahendra, her mother and chachi drive down the highway, Siya asks, ""Aisa nyay ka kya jab koi zinda hi na ho?"" ,Siya looks longingly at a peer – a girl! – in uniform, as she drops off her little brother at school. She had hoped for an education and to earn a living. Instead, she runs on a hamster wheel, teaching her brother how to read in between a mountain of household chores.

Katiyal is a ruthless businessman who will go to any lengths to make a profit. He is successful and well connected in Kuwait and Iraq. Katiyal calls himself a Kuwaiti and is generally derisive towards Indians. He has a large and well appointed mansion in Kuwait, he makes a happy home with his wife Amrita and his sweet little daughter Simu.Late that evening he receives word that Iraq has attacked Kuwait.  At this point Katiyal believes the attack is one of the many minor border skirmishes. He asks Amrita to take the child away to London for a few days until things cool down.In short order he discovers that the attack was not a minor skirmish. Iraqi soldiers are overruning Kuwait and plundering the city and indiscriminately targeting and murdering Kuwaiti citizens. Katiyal and Nair drive to the Indian Embassy. They are stopped by angry Iraqi soldiers  and when Nair begins pleading in Arabic he is shot dead. Katiyal manages to reach the Embassy. The consul, a friend of Katiyal, explains that the Kuwaiti government  has fled and Kuwaiti money is now worthless. The 170,000 Indians in Kuwait are now refugees until India decides its policy.Katiyal returns. He is pulled out at a checkpost and taken to the Emir palace. Iraqi Major Khalaf is now in charge. He chides Katiyal for not remembering him from his previous visits to Iraq. He explains that Iraq has always enjoyed good relations with India and now he extends his own personal friendship to Katiyal by which he means Katiyal should transact business with him; business now includes supplies, transport out of Kuwait and anything else that may be needed. Katiyal hurries home; his mansion is looted but his wife and child are safe at his office. Katiyal meets with his friends . After some initial confusion he manages to convince them to stay together. A makeshift camp is set up at a nearby school and some 500 Indians move in. Amrita urges Katiyal to use his clout to extricate his own family but Katiyal  appears to have a change of heart.Katiyal decides to stay and help the others get out. He eventually discovers that the Indian Embassy has been evacuated as well. He phones the Indian External Affairs Ministry in New Delhi where he reaches Joint Secretary Kohli who, as is common in the Ministry, redirects him to another officer. As Katiyal is trying to reach someone the camp is looted by Iraqi soldiers. Katiyal reaches the Major who explains that his soldiers need food and may return again. The Major also reveals that Saddam has already permitted Indians to leave Kuwait. Katiyal goes to Baghdad to try and set up a way out of Kuwait.Arriving in Baghdad Katiyal discovers that the Indian Embassy is of no help.  Kuwaitis in Iraq have also fled. The only remaining option, Iraqi Foreign Minister Aziz is somewhat helpful. He is a friend of Katiyal and is sympathetic to the cause. He discloses that an Indian merchant ship is due to arrive in Iraq and he will tacitly permit the 500 Indians to leave on the ship. Katiyal is grateful and returns to Kuwait with the news. But as soon as the buses are loaded and ready to leave Katiyal receives the distressing news that there is a UN embargo and ships are barred from entering or leaving Iraq. One of Katiyal's cantankerous employees rails against him. Amrita comes to his defense and after a loud argument everyone is resolutely supportive of Katiyal.Katiyal continues to keep in touch with the Indian Ministry officer Kohli but Kohli is somewhat of a sluggard. But when his own father recounts their tale of woe during the partition of India, Kohli awakens and begins to actively petition the Minister. The Minister sadly explains that they are in a weak coalition government and the Kuwaiti problem is not a high priority. But Kohli persists and the Minister, half in frustration and half in agreement, asks Kohli to handle it. Kohli approaches Air India  and orchestrates an evacuation of the 170,000 Indians in Kuwait.The last part of the plan is arduous. Katiyal bluffs and threatens the Major to get him to let them leave.

Naina's world turns Topsy-Turvy when she gets arrested for the murder of her secret lover Arjun . Her lawyer Jimmy  hires prestigious defense attorney, Badal Gupta  to defend her, and over the course of one late evening, they work together to find out what actually happened on that fateful day. Badal tells Naina that a witness has landed and it will result in her getting arrested in no time. Naina explains that she and Arjun were blackmailed by someone for their extramarital affair. They were called to a hotel room in a remote location and told to bring money. When they arrive, Naina receives a text from Arjun's phone saying that the blackmailer is going to reveal the truth. She is suddenly attacked and becomes unconscious. When she wakes up, she finds Arjun dead with the blackmail money scattered everywhere and the police knocking. Naina gets arrested but claims that she did not commit the murder. The police finds no clue of anyone else being present in the room or breaking in. The Allen key, which opens the windows of the hotel rooms, was removed due to heavy snow.Badal gets suspicious that Naina is not being honest with him and says he needs more information to build her case. He takes out the newspaper clipping about a youth named Sunny who had gone missing near the hotel and asks Naina how is she related to it.
Naina, then starts narrating her story. The story begins three months prior when she had lied to her husband about travelling to Paris for a business trip and instead went to a cabin outside of Scotland to meet Arjun. At the end of their getaway, Naina feels guilty about lying to her husband and daughter so she tells Arjun that she would like to end their relationship. While driving home, they get into a heated argument about this matter when a deer appears in front of the car and Naina loses control. She hits a car from the opposite direction. The impact kills the driver of the other car . Naina panics but Arjun tells her that they cannot call the police if they want to proceed with their life. He convinces her that Sunny wasn't wearing a seat-belt and had been texting so his death was not their fault. They decide to flee but their own car fails to start and a car approaches them. Arjun hides Sunny's dead body and pretends that he is the owner of Sunny's car. When the driver stops to check, Naina and Arjun pretend that they are trading insurance information to deal with the accident. Sunny's phone starts ringing so Arjun answers it and pretends as if he is talking to insurance agents. Once the driver leaves convinced, Naina disposes off Sunny's car in a swamp.A couple, Rani  and Nirmal, stop their car and ask Arjun if he needs any help. Arjun is invited back to the couple's house to get Naina's car fixed. Upon arriving, he realizes that the couple are Sunny's parents, who are worried about their son. Rani calls to Sunny's phone and since Arjun forgot to dispose off Sunny's phone, it starts ringing. Arjun pretends that he had just been sitting on it but Rani and Nirmal are suspicious. Arjun and Naina return home but seeing Sunny on the news channel, they get worried that they will be discovered.
Soon, Naina is identified as a suspect in Sunny's disappearance when the couple identifies her vehicle. Naina had already disposed off her car and registers a missing case  in Scotland. This prompts the officials to ask Naina for evidence of her time there. Since Naina was never in Paris, she has Jimmy falsify her alibi and is able to remove her name from Sunny's case. Arjun uses his wife's connections to the bank to make it seem as though Sunny had been stealing money from the bank and had run away. This way, the police no longer believe Sunny had been killed. However, Naina feels guilty and is upset at Arjun's actions. Refusing to believe her son could ever steal, Rani confronts Naina disguised as an economist at a business event. She reveals that she knows Naina had never been in Paris and that Naina is her last hope to know the whereabouts of her son. She also recognizes Naina's lighter, which Nirmal handed back to Arjun when he was leaving their house. Naina refuses to help Rani. A few months later, Naina and Arjun are contacted by a blackmailer. The blackmailer has Arjun throw away his phone prior to showing up at the Glen Moehr Hotel, the site of the murder. Thus, the blackmailer sends Naina a text prior to framing her.Badal decides that Rani had a motive for killing Arjun and could have easily done so since Nirmal works in the Glen Moehr Hotel . He tells Naina that it is quite possible for Rani to have hidden in the room  and received The Allen key for the window , allowing a quick escape. They can blame Rani and Nirmal for Arjun's murder and get Naina out of the case. He also suggests to Naina that she should say that she was in Paris, as her records show, on the day of Sunny's murder, which will put the onus on Arjun as the murderer of Sunny. He pressures Naina to reveal the location of Sunny's body as he wants to tie Sunny's death to Arjun.
However, Naina, having gained trust in Badal, reveals that Sunny was alive in the trunk before she disposed off the car, but she decided to kill him in order to clear her name. Surprised by Naina's murderous and selfish actions, Badal proposes an alternate sequence of events in which Naina pressurized Arjun into hiding Sunny's disappearance. In this sequence of events, Arjun grows a guilty conscience to the point where he travels to the hotel to reveal the truth to Rani and Nirmal. He sends the text that Naina claims is from the blackmailer, prompting Naina to kill him. With the police knocking, Naina decides to injure herself and blame Rani for the crime. Naina refuses these events and claims that what Badal proposed before was the truth.Given this story, Badal refuses to fight Naina's case. Naina begs for Badal's help and Badal asks her to honestly reveal whether or not she killed Arjun. Naina confesses her role in Arjun's murder. Despite her guilty confession, Badal agrees to fight her case and reveals that there was no surprise witness. He had simply bluffed to make Naina tell him the truth. Badal then excuses himself in order to take a walk outside. Meanwhile, Naina receives a call from Jimmy. During the call, she realizes that Badal's pen is interfering with the call. When the real Badal Gupta arrives outside her door, Naina takes apart Badal's pen to reveal a voice recorder that had recorded every word of their meeting. She discovers that she had actually been speaking with Nirmal, who had disguised himself as Badal. Rani calls the police and Nirmal quotes the Mahabharata, saying that Draupadi's  revenge has been taken by Yudhishthira .

2213054,Kai po che!,Drama Sport Bhatt party cricket shop mall film sports start starts friends sister business budding upcoming,Drama Sport friends set produce country stars growing open training academy cricket,"The film begins with Govind ""Govi"" Patel in 2012 giving a presentation in a school about the services provided by his sports club. Omkar ""Omi"" Shastri, in a parallel scene, is released from prison and Govi picks him up. While halting at a restaurant mid-way, Govi and Omi recall their days back to the year 2000 with the life of their friend Ishaan.

Ten years ago
Ishaan ""Ish"" Bhatt is an ex-district level cricketer in 2000 who is a victim of politics in the cricketing selection fraternity, Omi is the nephew of a Hindu politician, Bishakh ""Bittu"" Joshi, who funds his father's temple and Govi is a geek with a penchant for business and numbers. Together they open a sports shop and an academy to train and promote talented budding cricketers. After toiling hard, they succeed in establishing it as a center for cricket among the local youth and start to incur profits.

Ishaan requests Govi to teach his sister Vidya ""V"" Bhatt mathematics for her upcoming exams. Govind is reluctant at first but agrees eventually. Vidya and Govi gradually become close to each other. Omi discovers the same and warns Govi of the consequences, as Ish is very protective of his sister.

The three friends spot Ali Hashmi, who has a rare talent for cricket, and Ish starts training him vigorously. Govi is ambitious and wants to expand the budding business by opening a shop in a mall in an upcoming part of the city. With financial help coming from Bittu, the trio set up shop in the mall. On 26 January 2001, a destructive earthquake hits Gujarat and the mall is destroyed. Govi is devastated because they invested a large amount of money and now face massive debt. Omi is forced to work for Bittu's right-wing party due to the money they owe him.

When relief camps of Bittu's party decline to give Muslims shelter in troubled times, Ish and Omi quarrel over their politico-religious outlook and temporarily break off their friendship. They again reunite after India's surprise win in the test match against Australia on 15 March 2001. Omi gets busy with religious politics and joins Bittu's party. Ish and Govi, meanwhile, are busy with Ali and Vidya respectively. Tension arises in the political sphere when Bittu loses the elections in his constituency to his opponent Subodh Mehta, who is supported by Ali's father Naseer Hashmi, a local Muslim leader. As a part of his party's campaign, in 2002, Bittu sends pilgrims  to Ayodhya to the Ram Temple. Omi's parents are also among them; he has an emotional moment of reconciliation with his father before his leave. On the returning day, 27 February 2002, the shocking news of the Godhra train massacre reaches the people. Omi is shattered but Bittu convinces him to take revenge on the murderers of his parents.

Ish and Govi hide in Ali's house, fearing the communal riots which were about to start. As expected, the violence starts by sunset, and the mob led by Bittu storms into the Muslim locality, killing every Muslim in sight. A fight ensues between Naseer and Bittu, where Naseer fatally stabs Bittu in defense and rushes to save Ali and take shelter in their attic. Omi, enraged at Bittu's death, follows him with a gun. Meanwhile, Ish learns of Vidya and Govi's relationship, when he reads Vidya's text message in Govi's mobile phone about her periods. Enraged, he thrashes Govi while Omi enters the premises with a gun in hand, desperate to find and kill Ali and Naseer. Ish and Govi hurriedly try to stop Omi as he desperately searches for Ali and Naseer. Omi finally aims and shoots at Ali and Naseer. Ish in a bid to save Ali takes the bullet himself and consequently dies, leaving both his friends, father and Vidya devastated.

Present day
The film then goes back to where it started, with Omi being released from prison. Govi and Vidya are married and have a son, whom they have named Ishaan after Ish. Vidya forgives Omi when he breaks down in front of her. The film ends with a now grown-up Ali debuting for the Indian cricket team against Australia. He plays his first shot by hitting the ball to the boundary with a cover drive just like Ish had taught him. Ish's spirit smiles at Ali's achievement and fades away smiling.","['Drama', 'Sport']",Three friends growing up in India at the turn of the millennium set out to open a training academy to produce the country's next cricket stars.,"Chillar Party,Phas Gaye Re Obama,Dangal,Kanpuriye,83,M.S.

Mohan's parents, Shyam and Tulsi, were very grateful for this help and wanted to thank the person who donated the money. They went to the address of the donor, but they found out that Raj had been pretending to be poor so that Pia could go to a different school.

1907761,Stanley Ka Dabba,Comedy Drama Family dabba lunch friends class dabbas concert break restaurant home time teacher bring food,Comedy Drama Family box school-teacher forbids forces children share food entering school brings,"Stanley  is a fourth grader at Holy Family school in Mumbai and is very popular among his friends. He is talented and well liked by his peers. The English teacher, Ms. Rosy,  is particularly impressed with his creativity, wit, and humour. Stanley is shown with a bruised face in the opening scene of the movie. On being questioned about it by Ms. Rosy, he concocts an elaborate story, much to her amusement. His humorous essays and offhand poem recitations make him her favourite in class. However his imagination is not always rewarded; his science teacher  rebukes his attempt at constructing a light house as part of the class project since it does not adhere to the topics covered in class.

It is shown early on that he doesn't bring his lunch box or 'dabba' to school, unlike all his other classmates. Verma  is a ravenous Hindi teacher; a phagomaniac who does not bring his own dabba either but lusts after everyone else's, also stealing food on occasion. The kids at school nickname him as 'Khadoos' . He has a poor reputation among his peers for his mindless and inconsiderate gluttony. He particularly eyes the dabba of one of Stanley's friends and shamelessly joins the group in class as soon as the lunch bell goes off to gorge on their food. A lot of his class time is spent discussing what his students brought for lunch.

One day, he ends up coming late during lunch-break and misses out on eating what he had earlier hoped to eat from the children's dabbas. Upon realising that the food in question was shared with Stanley, Khadoos berates him for not getting his own dabba. Stanley senses Khadoos' hostility towards him and avoids eating from his friends' dabbas thereafter, telling them every day during lunch break that he is going home to enjoy a hot meal prepared by his mother. His friends catch his bluff soon after when they find him loitering around the school during lunch break. When confronted, Stanley tells them that there is no one to cook for him until his parents get back from Delhi. Eager to help their hungry friend out, Stanley's friends start hiding from Khadoos during lunch break while sharing their dabbas with Stanley. Chagrined, Khadoos starts hunting for them arduously during lunch break every day. He catches hold of them eventually on the terrace, empty dabbas in tow. Upon realising that the group shared their lunches with Stanley again, he menacingly threatens Stanley to either bring his own dabba or stop coming to school. Stanley obliges and stops coming to school.

In this time, Stanley's friends come to know of an inter-school concert that they think he would be a perfect fit for. However, since he is debarred from school by Khadoos, Stanley remains sceptical about his chances. He secretly starts attending practice sessions for the concert and begins learning the dance steps and song lyrics by himself. Soon after, he is spotted practising by one of the organizers of the concert. His talent is recognised and he is immediately included in the troupe. In the meantime, Stanley's absence is felt by his teachers and friends, who finally spill the beans to Ms. Rosy about the reason behind his nonattendance. Aghast and disgusted, Ms. Rosy confronts Khadoos in front of other staff members asking him to ""have some shame"" since Stanley ""is just a child"". Khadoos begins realising his folly.

One fine day, Stanley brings his own dabba to school. He offers it to Khadoos on a platter and asks him for permission to come back to school. Guilt-ridden and shame-faced, Khadoos resigns from his post. He apologises to Stanley in a handwritten letter and promises to never return.

Meanwhile, the inter-school concert is attended by the entire staff of Holy Family, all of whom appreciate Stanley's performance. Ms. Rosy congratulates Stanley after the concert and offers him a ride home. However, he refuses saying that his mother is waiting for him in her car. The school's Principal  later drops Stanley home, which we realise isn't ""home"" but the restaurant at which he works. An orphan, Stanley is frequently physically abused by the proprietor of the restaurant , leaving him badly bruised. He hits Stanley in the face for remaining absent from work for the majority of the day. A cook at the restaurant, Akram, empathises with Stanley and promises to pack leftovers at the restaurant into his 'dabba' every day, without his uncle's knowledge. Stanley and Akram stay back and clean the place up for the night. The scene ends with Stanley lighting a candle next to a photograph of his parents, before going to bed. The next day onward, Stanley brings his own dabba to school and shares it with everyone while regaling them with details about how his mother prepared everything.","['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Family']","A school-teacher, who forces children to share their food with him, forbids one from entering the school until he brings his own Tiffin/Lunch-box.","OMG 2,Nasha,Chittagong,Hello Charlie,Chillar Party,Piku"

7881550,Kaamyaab,Drama dialogue dream actor world career role films film life meet forced present kind enthusiasm lost,Drama Sudheer actor heyday retirement retired record realizes verge accomplishing unique decides complete round figure,"""We first meet Sudheer  down and out, forced to present his life as a side-kick with the kind of enthusiasm that he has lost with time. He sits on his couch, his shoulders dipping, reciting the one dialogue that has outgrown his career as an actor. His introduction begins with a long montage of his career. He has been everything – a cop, a dacoit, a housekeeper of a haunted villa, doctor. This montage is a quick reminder for the audience of those actors we recognize by face but fail to care enough about to get their names. They exist, only to create a world that an Amitabh Bachchan or a Dharmendra would own.

It is during that interview that we see a shift in Sudheer. He is told by an over-anxious journalist that according to IMDB he has four-hundred-and-ninety-nine films to his credit as an actor. Sudheer takes note of that as if pushed back by memories of an entire lifetime of work. A dream takes birth in his mind right then. A dream further turned into a liveable reality by a friend. A dream of adding one more film to his filmography. Ending his career on a high of five-hundred films. A round figure, immortalized by a film, a role that makes him more than a side-kick of 70’s-80’s films.

This journey is as much about the number five-hundred as it is about Sudheer struggling to find an identity for himself that suits the modern times. He is stuck in a world where he used to be a common face in movies. The world around him  forces him to be repeatedly fooled into believing that the identity of his old self continues to be relevant. The TV anchor in the opening scene informs Sudheer that his most famous dialogue – Bas enjoying life, aur option kya hai? – has morphed into a WhatsApp forward over the course of time, wanting him to feel good about how the dialogue has aged. The truth is, in a mutated existence of that dialogue lies the sad ruins of Sudheer’s inability to grow past that one little moment of reckoning.

Sudheer is evidently tired of being asked to repeat that dialogue over-and-over again. He needs a new dialogue. A better iconic moment on-screen and that is what this dream offers him. His old actor friend and now casting director  helps him fulfill that dream. He finds that elusive five-hundredth role, but there is more to life and acting than just landing a role.

On the set of his five-hundredth film , Sudheer’s first take is ruined by an external reason. What follows is the complete collapse of an actor who has rarely given multiple takes for a dialogue. He fumbles, and finally falls. The world around him has changed, Sudheer realizes as the metaphorical sun sets behind his defeated shadow. This is not a role that would fall into place in the first take, and he has little experience of acting once it goes past the first few takes. He is a misfit, something he had not even considered until this point.",['Drama'],"Sudheer is an actor from the heyday of Bollywood. Years after his retirement, he realizes that he 'retired' on the verge of accomplishing a unique record. He decides to come out of his retirement to complete the round figure of 500.","Tadka,Nazar Andaaz,Kaun Pravin Tambe?,Nautanki Saala!,Aashiqui 2,Aanchhi"

Hidayat Khan is the son of an Indian freedom fighter and agent posing as an informant for the Pakistani government. He wishes to make his 20-year old daughter Sehmat an agent and continue the family tradition of being in service to the country as a last wish before his impending death from lung cancer. Sehmat leaves college against the wishes of her mother Teji Khan, and to prepare her to spy, she is hastily trained by senior RAW officer Khalid Mir and his assistant, a young Bakshi, in various fields, including martial arts and shooting. She learns of other agents in Pakistan and their contacts, and practices converting text information to Morse code, which she has to use while transmitting information to India.Khan uses his friendship with Brigadier Syed of the Pakistan Army to get Sehmat married to his son, Iqbal Syed, another military officer. After the marriage and migration to Pakistan, Sehmat quickly settles into her married life, adjusts to a new country, and establishes the trust and confidence of her in-laws. Brigadier Syed is promoted to Major General shortly afterwards, which results in crucial national security documents and senior members of the country's defense forces passing through his house. Sehmat soon establishes communication channels with her handlers back in India and starts relaying information. Meanwhile, she falls in love with Iqbal and develops physical proximity with him.Eventually, Sehmat spots information related to the planning of an offensive against India and, at great risk, is able to gather the necessary details and pass them on. One of the servants, Abdul, discovers the truth about Sehmat and rushes out to inform the others. She chases him and is forced to murder him with a jeep to avoid exposing her cover. The event takes a heavy emotional toll on her. The information she passed on points to the planned attack on the Indian aircraft carrier INS Vikrant, then deployed in the Bay of Bengal and provided one of the initial warnings to the threat.Sehmat is left with no choice but to also kill Mehboob Syed, Iqbal's brother and an army officer after he begins investigating Abdul's death and finds her suspicious. Sehmat is mentally disturbed, having widowed Munira, Mehboob's wife, but quickly recovers. She is eventually discovered as a spy by Iqbal, who is heartbroken by the revelation. Iqbal confronts Sehmat with the police but dies from a bomb thrown by Khalid Mir to cause her death should she be caught. Sehmat is alive, having switched places with another burqa-clad agent. She realizes the insignificance of relationships and humanity in this line of work. Broken by the destruction of a family by her hand and everything she has seen and had to do, Sehmat requests Khalid to allow her to return to India. After she does, it is discovered that she is pregnant with Iqbal's child. She says that she will keep him and raise him alone.With Sehmat's findings, the INS Rajput sinks the Pakistani submarine PNS Ghazi off Visakhapatnam's coast. This starts the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, which ends with the Pakistani Instrument of Surrender, an Indian victory. Bakshi concludes his speech, with Samar Saeed, Sehmat's son, among the addressed officers.","['Action', 'Drama', 'Thriller']",A Kashmiri woman agrees to marry a Pakistani army officer in order to spy on Pakistan during the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971.,"Romeo Akbar Walter,Baadshaho,Code Name: Tiranga,Bajrangi Bhaijaan,Rangoon,Attack"
1839596,Rockstar,Drama Music Romance music love heart emotions emotion family started life frustration fine-spirited expectations star good set grew tracks peace guitar,Drama Music Romance Rock chases star dreams big falls love,"There was a star good at heart, fine-spirited with expectations. He grew with zeal for his music, simple yet conducive of his nature which was cheerfully accepted by his close friends and family. He set out to the streets with his guitar in search of a passion for art, running after the glory of Jim Morrison's fame; his eclectic persona charmed all who listened to his music, his aria. But there was a twist in his role that was played by 'Janardan', the protagonist; he did not see any side of romance since. He was imbued with the thrill of stardom by his mentor who said him the change in every true artist's life started with a pain; an urge which led him instrumentally to an overture of a failed love and a falsely attained conspicuous success as an established musician. He was thrown out of his own family, which was filled with wrath and hatred for him based on distrust. The movie had several prominent human emotions sprouting up one after another and used a 'stream of consciousness' as it progressed keeping the capriccioso of the music tracks in harmony with every node of changing emotions--- It started with 'peace' for Janardan as his life had simplicity while he set out for his journey. Following it were feelings of 'love', when he fell for the beauty and lust of the dancing diva of the college Heer- gorgeous, arrogant and snobbishly cynical. Whilst these emotions marked the rungs in the story, Janardan turned into notorious 'Jordan' and his fan-following grew overwhelmingly as he contracted a leading music enterprise. Then came along 'despair', as Heer's marriage was certain to an affluent family; both of them had very little to do about it, but Jordan's parlous love began to be requited. Going along the flow, despair was replaced with 'anger' and 'fury' in Jordan's life; his heart started bleeding when he saw her closeness with her Prague-based spouse Jai and felt she already belonged to him. The next emotion had to be 'frustration', while gradually a sturdy possession worked up in him for his ladylove and it turned up in torrents. An outcast, Jordan was charged with numerous criminal offences including resisting arrest and publicly assaulting on the media. Slowly but surely, his pure feelings for Heer took to lust, a sin which he was the last person to resist.Jordan, with his guitar and simple music and a pure serene heart transformed into a frenetic ""rock-star"" with hysterical rock music, a dark heart, failed love and proving frustration; his love for career was defaced- took a wrong turn, as his repressed love Heer, the second side of the coin, went to coma.The last emotion 'peace' is symbolic of a crux, marked by the painful track ""tum ko pa hi liya..."" reeking of a constant unfathomable pain, rebel and frustration for Jordan and a climactic ordeal for Heer.The movie is drenched by stunning music tracks suiting and marking every emotion distinctively-- courtesy : the maestro A.

Rahman.","['Drama', 'Music', 'Romance']","Janardhan Jakhar chases his dreams of becoming a big Rock star, during which he falls in love with Heer.","Heroine,Kaamyaab,Tum Bin 2,Teri Meri Kahaani,Lust Stories,Hate Story IV"
13028258,A Thursday,Drama Thriller Minister Prime dem rine police school find driver working inside send lso,Drama Thriller teacher students hostage playschool Rattling leaders country police demands send shockwaves,"Naina Jaiswal is a teacher at the Little Tots play school in Colaba. She was on leave for three weeks for some unknown reason. We come to know that the school is located in the front portion of the property owned by Rohit Mirchandani, Naina's fiance. Rohit also lives on the same property. The parents come to drop off their kids, and Naina requests one of the parents to send a cake, as she remembered that it was their daughter, Niharika's, birthday the next day. She asked if their driver could deliver the cake to the school. Everybody leaves the premises, and something snaps inside Naina. There is a devilish fervor inside her that is ready to burn anything and everything that comes her way. She calls the Colaba police station and informs them that she has 16 children as hostages.Just then, Niharika's driver arrives with a cake. Savitri, the helper, also, unfortunately, returns to take her phone, which she had forgotten. Both of them are taken into captivity as Naina has no other option. The police officials came to see if the call received was a prank or if there was actually something happening. Naina fires a shot to let the authorities know that she means business. Catherine Alvarez, the ACP, gets in touch with her, and Naina keeps an unusual demand that she would only negotiate with an officer named Javed Khan.Naina initiates her death game, and Javed Khan is brought to the scene. She tells Javed that she would free one kid for every demand met. The first demand she makes is that she wants five crore rupees transferred into her account. Catherine Alvarez and Javed Khan had a history together, due to which they were not very compatible while working together. Catherine does not listen to Javed and tries to send a force inside. It results in Naina killing one of the kids, named Aakash. The commissioner of police gives the complete charge to Javed and sends Catherine to do the background research as both of them had major disagreements that were not benefiting the current situation.Naina's second demand is that she wants to talk to the Prime Minister. Unable to find a solution, the forces give in to the demand. The Prime Minister, Maya Rajguru, talks to Naina on the phone, and the latter urges her to come in person and meet her. Naina tells Javed Khan to find two guys, Rakesh Mathur and Charan Kumar, who she last knew were working at BWC school in Goregaon, and bring them to her. The police are able to locate Rakesh Mathur, but they cannot find Charan Kumar. No one knows what Naina is up to, and Javed Khan and his team have no choice but to agree to what she says because the children are still in her custody.Catherine discovers, while conducting a background check, that Naina has been taking antidepressants and visiting psychologist since she was 16 years old. She searches Naina's house and finds receipts for the medicine prescribed by doctor Juneja. She gets in touch with Dr. Juneja, while Javed Khan gets hold of Naina's mother. The information that they get from both of them makes the picture a bit clearer. Naina had been raped when she was 16 years old. Javed Khan and Catherine were the officers in charge of the case. They both did not pay attention to Naina's case as they were chasing this high-profile case to get into the limelight. Naina's mother begged them for a couple of years and then started living with the trauma as there was no one who would address her grievances.Prime Minister Maya Rajguru decides to meet Naina in person. She is accompanied only by Javed Khan. Naina brings up the POCSO Act, which came into effect in the year 2012. It was enacted in order to protect children under 18 years of age against sexual offenses. Naina asks the Prime Minister why there isn't anything for people over 18. She demands that the Prime Minister assure her right then and there that rape offenders will face the death penalty. The PM tells Naina that amending the rules or passing an act is a complex task that requires time, but also assures her that she will make sure that her rapists are found and put behind bars. That is when Naina reveals the final information that shocks both the people present in the room and those watching it live on social media.For some reason, the police were not able to find Charan Kumar. Charan Kumar was the same person who had brought Niharika's birthday cake and was working as a driver for the family. It was an accident that Charan Kumar landed with the cake. Naina had asked Niharika's mother to send her driver with the cake, as she had figured three weeks back that Charan Kumar was working for them. He was the one who had raped her while Rakesh Mathur held her hands. Naina shoots Charan Kumar and takes her revenge.The commandos enter the house and take Naina into custody. While Naina is being transported to prison, Maya Rajguru brings up the issue of capital punishment in parliament.","['Drama', 'Thriller']","Naina, a playschool teacher, takes 16 students hostage.

7142506,Sir,Drama Romance family dream back sister relationship fashion designer work person life house learns stays independent return feelings emotionally,Drama Romance young man servant designer prosperous falls love widow dream fashion,"Ratna is an on premise maid employed by Ashwin and his girlfriend, Sabina.

Ashwin has recently returned to Mumbai from New York, leaving behind his dream to be a writer, after learning his brother is not well. He stays back to support his family emotionally when his brother dies. Ratna is an independent person with self-respect. However, as a widow from a small village her prospects are extremely limited. She is working in Mumbai to be self-sufficient and also financially helps her family, and encourages her sister to study. It was her dream to study which she could not fulfill because of marriage and now she wants her sister to get educated. She also nurtures a dream to become a fashion designer.

The movie opens with Ratna being called back for work as Ashwin has left his to-be wife, Sabina on their wedding day and has come back home. From the conversations with his friends and family we learn that Sabina had cheated on him and he wasn't really in love with her. He stays low spirited for days until Ratna, not able to see him unhappy, narrates her story of losing her husband after just 4 months when she was 19 years old but now she is an independent woman who is supporting her family. She says ""life never stops"", implying we should move on with our life whatever may come. She stays back to work at his house, defying the possibility of gaining a bad reputation for living with a man alone.

We gradually learn that Ashwin is a nice person who does not care about class differences and respects Ratna like any other person in his life. He speaks up for her when an acquaintance of his scolds Ratna for accidentally spilling a drink on her. Over time Ashwin learns about Ratna's dream to become a fashion designer when Ratna asks Ashwin's permission to go to tailoring classes and expresses her wish to become a fashion designer. Ashwin initially thinks light of her desire, but immediately corrects himself and apologises to Ratna, saying 'everyone has the right to dream'. Ratna empathises with Ashwin as he is stuck in Mumbai for his family, and is not able to follow his dream to write. They sync emotionally.

Ratna gifts Ashwin a handmade shirt for his birthday. He wears the shirt to work that same day, agreeing to Ratna's request not to tell anyone she made it for him. Meanwhile Ratna learns that her sister is getting ready for marriage before completing her diploma. She is disappointed to know her sister is more enthusiastic to come to Mumbai than to complete her studies. But Ashwin consoles her by saying that the groom might be a good person, who wants his wife to be independent. He gives her some money as a gift for her sister's wedding even though she resists. He calls her when she is away for the wedding to check in with her. The attention makes her uncomfortable, and emotionally confused.

Upon her return to work for Ashwin, the dynamic changes between them. Ashwin becomes enamoured with Ratna. He also gives Ratna a sewing machine as a gift. Soon after, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, Ashwin returns home to find a carefree Ratna dancing with a crowd of people celebrating the festival. After a silent but charged elevator ride up to his apartment, Ashwin expresses his feelings. Ratna allows Ashwin's advances for a moment while they share a kiss, then strongly expresses her will against any possible relationship. When Ashwin asks her to go out with him, she takes him to the building rooftop where they share some thoughts and have a conversation. Ashwin discourages her from calling him 'sir' while Ratna asks him to forget about their encounter that night. When Ashwin's friend learns of his feelings, he discourages him from being in a relationship with a maid and reminds him of the social repercussions of such a relationship. He says that for Ratna's sake, he should not act on his feelings. The next day, Ratna, as the maid, is asked to cook for a party at Ashwin's mother's place. Ashwin unintentionally makes Ratna uncomfortable by asking if he should wait for her to go back home, provoking mockery from other household employees.

When they return to Ashwin's apartment, Ratna makes it clear that they cannot be in a relationship as she will not be welcome among his family and friends, and vice-versa, and that if her family came to know of their relationship, she would be forced to return to a restrictive village life. When he insists on being together, she decides to quit her job and leaves, despite Ashwin's request that he might help her in any way even if she no longer wants to be in the house. She tells him not to worry for her or contact her. Ratna moves to her sister's house, while Ashwin tells his father that he is in love with Ratna and will be moving back to New York. After some time, we see Ratna getting hired by Ashwin's friend who is a fashion designer, through Ashwin's recommendation. Ratna rushes off to Ashwin's house to see him but finds the door bolted and the flat vacant. Dejected, she goes to the rooftop, where she unexpectedly receives a call from Ashwin. Finally, understanding his insistence on seeing her as an equal, she reconciles with her identity crisis and responds to his call by addressing him by his first name ""Ashwin"". This also indicates that despite social differences, there can be love.","['Drama', 'Romance']","A prosperous young Indian man falls in love with his servant, a widow with the dream of becoming a fashion designer.","Tadka,Tiku weds Sheru,Aiyyaa,Jayantabhai Ki Luv Story,Goodbye,Hate Story IV"

Together with an ostentatious crew that is led by Tayaji  and cousin Jassi , he indulges in uncontrolled consumption of cocaine. Tommy is popular for his adrenaline-pumping songs, with lyrics that often glorify violence and drug-addiction. However, his addiction soon costs him his music contract and lands him in jail. In prison, he meets two of his die-hard fans, who remark how Tommy's lifestyle had 'inspired' theirs, leading them to commit murder. Realizing that his songs have adversely and negatively affected teenagers, Tommy decides to change his ways upon release. A few days later, Tommy engages in an altercation with Tayaji and accidentally shoots him, injuring his ear. This causes Tayaji to send Tommy and his crew away to a farmhouse so that he can prepare for an upcoming concert.Working on the farm is a Bihari migrant worker named Kumari Pinky , frequently called Bauria. Bauria's dreams of playing national level hockey for the country were shattered, so she came to Punjab to work as a laborer. Bauria works for a local landlord who uses agriculture as a front for drug peddling. One night, while walking around the farm, she finds a suspicious packet, one actually thrown from across the border. She soon realizes that it is some kind of drug, and resolves to sell it. Her search for a potential buyer lands her in great trouble as she unwittingly contacts the original owners of the heroin. She is chased and eventually captured by the gang of drug peddlers but not before she discards it into a well. As a compensation for their lost drugs, the peddlers forcibly keep Bauria at their farm house where she is sexually and physically abused, given drugs and prostituted to several men - including police officers from the local police force. Some weeks later, Bauria manages to escape from the house.In the neighboring town lives Preet Sahni , a doctor and activist who runs a rehabilitation center. Sartaj Singh  is a junior policeman attached to the town's station, who knows about the smuggling of drugs his seniors are allowing on a large scale. But when it affects his family, as his brother, Balli , overdoses on Chaand  and is brought to Preet's clinic, he realizes the grave situation. She educates Sartaj about the drug problem and partly accuses him for his brother's state. Together, they decide to find the root cause of the problem. Balli is admitted in Preet's drug rehabilitation center against his will.Appearing before his audience in a concert, instead of singing, Tommy starts preaching. Infuriated by his speech about how one should lead his/her life, his fans try to admonish him, and start throwing bottles at him. Tommy gets angry and urinates in front of the crowd. Making a run out of the concert to save himself from the crowd's angst, Tommy goes and hides inside a dilapidated structure. There he meets Bauria and together they start sharing their stories. However, the next day, Bauria is recaptured by the same gang which had kept her imprisoned. Tommy learns the next day that an arrest warrant has been issued for him because of the public ruckus he created at the concert. He sets out to find Bauria after realizing his true feelings for her. He finds that she is kept in a farmhouse and goes there.Preet and Sartaj find that the driving force behind the drug problem in Punjab is an elderly man called Virender Singh, who has flourished with the support of MP Maninder Brar. Sartaj and Preet go to extreme measures to collect evidence against the politician and put together a report to be sent to the state's Election Commission, to thwart Brar's campaign for another term in power. Sartaj soon develops feelings for her and asks her out, which she reciprocates. However,the same night,while returning home, Preet sees a manic Balli, who was being treated against his wish at her rehab center trying to escape. On trying to stop him, she gets stabbed accidentally by Balli. The policemen who come to investigate her homicide, including Sartaj's senior officer Jhujar Singh , also come across the report made by Sartaj and Preet. Since he is Sartaj's mentor and close friend, Jhujar decides to protect Balli by sending Balli underground for a while and creating a scene of murder for gain. But he gets infuriated when he sees that he too has been named in the drug racket, and calls Sartaj at the site.In the presence of the local drug mafia in their farmhouse , a bruised and beaten Sartaj is questioned by Jhujar,who is also a key member in the drug racket, about the report. Sartaj says whatever he did was for the sake of Punjab. At the same time, Tommy, who is on the run from the police and has been searching for Bauria, enters the enclosure. Taking advantage of the opportunity, Sartaj grabs Jhujar's service pistol and shoots the whole gang except Tommy. He then rushes inside the house to free his brother Balli, who is being held captive. He frees Balli, while Tommy goes upstairs and helps Bauria escape from her captors. Finally, as Tommy and Bauria run off, Balli kneels down and cries in front of his brother, whose face is expressionless.In a later scene it is seen that the government has issued an inquiry into the activities of Maninder Brar and there has been a huge crackdown on the drug menace. And in a scene in Goa,amidst his crew members enjoying at the beach side, Tommy calls Kumari/Bauria from his crew member's phone to ask for her real name. Sitting by the beach, she catches sight of a foreigner having fun.

He says that he is in France and will try to reach there before Monday. She doesn't believe him and thinks he is joking, but her phone battery drains out before they can speak further. The next day, Jaggi persuades Gautam to make a step to his relationship and calls Ira, who wishes to talk it out. At the restaurant, Ira instead asks for divorce and tells Gautam to sign the papers. He angrily signs the papers and leaves. On the way home, Jaggi sees a swimsuit and desires to swim the English Channel wearing that swimsuit. Angry, Gautam takes Jaggi to a swimming pool and makes him swim continuously, believing that as the English Channel is 20 miles long it would be nearly suicidal to cover the entire length by swimming.The next day, Gautam is surprised to find Ira at his doorstep, and realizes that Jaggi, who has gone missing, is responsible for having made the call to her. Jaggi leaves behind a letter, stating that he will try to reunite with Kartika, no matter what. He then enters the sea in order to reach the other side of the United Kingdom. Here, Gautam and Ira try to find him out but they fail. Kartika is also concerned for him because Jaggi called her from a P.C.O. and claimed that he is coming for her through the channel.Jaggi swims long as he can go, but starts losing energy by the middle of the sea, and faints. He is saved by some strangers. Gautam informs Kartika that Jaggi is safe and that he tried to cross English Channel in order to reach her. He asks her if she would have really broken off her marriage in the event that Jaggi would have crossed the sea, but she is confused and doesn't have an answer. Seeing Jaggi's intense love for her, she falls in love with him. She confesses her feelings to Jaggi on phone and demands that he pick her up fast.Seeing the love between the two, Gautam helps Jaggi get a passport with a United Kingdom visa illegally. When Ira asks Gautam why he is risking his career for Jaggi, he admits that he felt guilty since Jaggi was willing to go to unimaginable lengths to reunite with his love but he himself wasn't. For the last time, Jaggi goes to meet Bilal and tells him everything.At the last moment when Gautam and Jaggi are about to board the plane, Bilal betrays Jaggi to the cops in return for a job, a house and legal citizenship. Seeing the police in search of him, Jaggi hides at the bottom of the plane.At the end, it is shown that Gautam and Ira reunited back and Gautam was telling Jaggi's love story to his friends as they were remembering him, as he concludes saying that everyone has a story of love, and the only common factor binding them is the intensity of that love.",['Romance'],"A passionate love story involving two couples which highlights the contrast between a regular, mature yet egoistic husband and a unique, happy go lucky, enamored, overzealous boy chasing after the love of his life.","Teri Meri Kahaani,Ek Villain Returns,Kanpuriye,Raat Akeli Hai,Love Hostel,Atrangi Re"

14418234,State of Siege: Temple Attack,Action Thriller State Siege Attack’ Temple team terrorists minister terrorist release attack,Action Thriller commandos Inspired events true film narrates heroic tale step save innocent people terrorists attack temple,"The plot of ‘State of Siege Temple Attack’ kicks off with Major Hanut Singh  and his team of NSG commandoes observing a couple of terrorist in the Kupwara district of J&K, who are suspected of having kidnapped a minister’s daughter.

After confirming the presence of the girl at the location, Singh refuses to wait for the oncoming strike team and heads in with another officer, Capt. Bibek , to rescue her. Just as they manage to secure her, a larger group of men shows up.The soldiers notice the presence of two wanted terrorists — Abu Hamza and Bilal Naikoo — among them and engage. They manage to capture Naikoo but as Singh manages to corner Hamza, a terrorist shoots both the officers, injuring Singh and killing his partner.

Cut to nine months later where Singh is still dealing with the traumatic aftermath of his poor decision making as a new mission pops up. The NSG is tasked with overseeing the security of CM Manish Choksi  in Gujarat during an event as there is word of a potential attack in the state.Elsewhere, in a terrorist training camp in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir, Hamza readies four men to infiltrate India for a lethal attack in order to demand Naikoo’s release. A small team of the NSG, led by their commanding officer Col. Nagar , flies to Gandhinagar and begin security protocol at the hotel where the minister has to deliver a speech.

Unfortunately for them, the four terrorists arrive at the Krishna Dham temple  in the city and open fire at civilians. They hunt and murder whoever they lay eyes on, and then get orders to take the remaining people hostage.

Abu Hamza contacts India’s Prime Minister and mentions Naikoo’s release, threatening that the perpetrators will kill one hostage every half hour until this demand is met. While the government decides on a plan of action, Singh convinces Nagar to let the NSG engage.NSG enters the action
Singh, accompanied by Captain Rohit Bagga , arrive at the scene just as the Rapid Action Force  suffers causalities while trying to break open the detonator laden temple door.

Despite being told to stay at the perimeter of the location, Singh and Bagga cautiously enter the complex. Unwilling to wait for the larger NSG squadron to fly over from Manesar, the duo start checking for survivors when they are shot at by one of the terrorists.

As they pursue and manage to kill him, they enter the temple’s auditorium where a second militant stands over a group of hostages. The commandoes use clever tactics and make quick work of him, and evacuate the first group of civilians from the complex.

Elsewhere, the government agrees to release Naikoo.

The unfortunate mole
One of the hostages in the exhibition section of the temple, Chintu , is the son of a sweet shop owner whose store is located right opposite the temple gate. In a moment of desperation, his father rings Chintu’s mobile which is picked up by one of the terrorists.Before realising who is on the other side, the man announces the arrival of the NSG. As the remaining two militants realise they have potential eyes, via this man, on the gate, they threaten to kill his son if he doesn’t inform them about every development outside the building. Regretting his haste, he has no option but to agree.

The militants then wrap a bomb on one of the wounded hostages — a young woman from Ahmedabad — and send her outside. Before Singh and his team realise their enemies’ ploy, the bomb explodes, seriously injuring one of the soldiers.

Meanwhile the larger NSG team, led by Major Samar Chauhan , arrives and relieve Singh and Bagga from the operation. Singh is reprimanded by Nagar for disobeying orders yet again, and is told to sit this one out until further orders.The final charge
Chauhan plans to climb the roof and attack the location from higher ground but is met with counter fire and a grenade due to the shopkeeper’s leaked information. Singh, who waits outside, realises the presence of a mole and investigates the surroundings.

He finally chances upon the disturbed man and corners him into revealing the truth. Knowing that the team engaging the enemy is at their mercy, Singh asks to be sent in again to finish this once and for all. Nagar agrees but warns him that he’s against the clock as Naikoo is close to reaching the border for his release.

Knowing he must finish the remaining terrorists before Naikoo is freed, he uses the shopkeeper to falsely convey a message that the NSG has given up and is retreating. He then asks Bagga to take to the roof and cautiously enters the exhibition area.

One of the militants sets up another bomb and prepares to blow everyone up but is met by an injured Chauhan. Elsewhere Singh gets into a hand-to-hand combat with the second one. He manages to stab him and kills the last one before he can press the detonator.

On the border, the army gets word of the operation’s success and guns down Naikoo before he can cross. Back in Gandhinagar, Chauhan and Singh make their way out of the complex in a worn out condition as the people mourn the losses of their loved ones.

The film ends with the NSG on the verge of raiding a housing locality in Gujarat to hunt for accomplices in the gruesome attack.","['Action', 'Thriller']","Inspired by true events, the film narrates the heroic tale of NSG commandos, who step in to save innocent people when terrorists attack a temple in Gujarat.","Hotel Mumbai,Uri: The Surgical Strike,Kesari,India&apos;s Most Wanted,Attack,Sooryavanshi"

Bhashkor's health quirks often lead to conflicts with Piku, their household servants, and Chhobi Mashi, Piku's maternal aunt, who frequently visits them. While Piku loves her father and takes good care of him since her mother's passing, she is frequently exasperated by his eccentric behaviors. Her colleague, Syed Afroz, is a close friend, and she frequently uses Rana Chaudhary's taxi service, a friend of Syed's. However, Piku's morning commute often becomes stressful due to arguments with Rana's taxi drivers, resulting in several car accidents.

Piku intends to sell their ancestral home in Kolkata, called Champakunj, but Bhashkor strongly opposes the idea and decides to visit Kolkata himself. Fearing for his health after a recent scare, Piku has no choice but to accompany him. Bhashkor insists on traveling by car, citing his constipation as the reason. However, due to Piku's previous conflicts with Rana's hired drivers, they all refuse to drive her. Piku attempts to book a flight to Kolkata, but Rana unexpectedly arrives at their home to take them to Kolkata himself, without informing his mother and sister about the trip.

During the journey, they encounter various incidents, with Rana's patience wearing thin due to Bhashkor's fussiness and constipation. Upon reaching Kolkata, Bhashkor requests Rana to stay with them for some time. As Piku and Rana spend time together in the city, they gradually grow closer. Rana also subtly suggests to Piku not to sell the ancestral house.

Rana eventually leaves Kolkata, and Bhashkor starts to abandon his eccentric habits, partly due to Rana's influence. Piku has a change of heart and decides not to sell the house. Meanwhile, Bhashkor's sudden interest in cycling increases, and he begins cycling alone through part of the city, causing concern for his family, as he did not inform them about his outings. When Bhashkor returns, Piku scolds him for eating street food and for being irresponsible. Still, he calmly mentions that his constipation has been relieved, and he now enjoys cycling every day. He recalls Rana's advice to enjoy a variety of foods without being overly choosy.

The following day, the family discovers that Bhashkor has passed away in his sleep, likely due to sleep apnea or cardiac arrhythmia. Piku believes he achieved the peaceful death he desired.

2855648,Madras Cafe,Action Drama Thriller movie product Gods time actors story Shoojit sit notice attempted roles filled producer promising acting,Action Drama Thriller intelligence journalist agent journeys war-torn coastal island break resolute rebel group meets passionate,"From time to time there comes a product that you have to sit up and take notice just because somebody even attempted it. Madras Café, with all its flaws, is one such movie. Ours has been a nation obsessed with Gods and saviors. Even more than the Jews, we Indians have always been looking for a savior to rescue us from the mire that is our lives. Our mythological stories are full of Gods to took human form to save mankind and our recent history is filled with people who are considered demi-Gods by their supporters. From Gandhi to Mamata, our leaders always evoke one of two reactions - total and unquestioned loyalty or complete and utter dismissal. In such an environment, Madras Café tries to tell the story of, arguably, the most important political event of our times. The assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, without a doubt, changed the face of Indian politics. Shoojit Sarkar and John Abraham, producer, have to be commended for trying to tell an unbiased story on how Rajiv Gandhi came to be assassinated in a most gruesome manner.The movie traces the story from the point of view of Bikram Singh, a RAW agent, who works undercover in Sri Lanka to undermine LTTE chief Prabhakaran and help get the peace process on track. Along the way, he is double crossed, kidnapped, lied to and loses the most cherished parts of his life. Unfortunately, John Abraham the actor does not live up to John Abraham the producer. Johns limited acting abilities mean that we are left feeling cold and unattached to the main protagonist. This is not the first time John has essayed a promising role in the most lifeless manner possible . The movie is filled with bad actors essaying promising roles or good actors essaying one-dimensional roles. For all the effort, Shoojit Sarkar fails to recreate the magic of Vicky Donor. He is let down by the script and the acting skills at his disposal. But it is not all gloomy. Instead there is a lot to recommend about the movie. For one, the photography is top-class. Shot mostly in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, Kamaljeet Negi does a fine job of capturing the beauty and horror that must have been Sri Lanka in the Prabhakaran era. The music by Shantanu Moitra is complementary without being intrusive to the storytelling. Then there is the fact that this movie was actually made. This is a moment when you have to put aside your demand for the perfect movie and watch Madras Café just so you can tell Bollywood that youd prefer this brand of cinema to the Khans brand. What John Abraham needs is to build a team of good technicians and actors. If he can continue to support and make money from the kind of cinema he believes in, it would be a turning point for Bollywood. Verdict: Must watch","['Action', 'Drama', 'Thriller']",An Indian intelligence agent journeys to a war-torn coastal island to break a resolute rebel group and meets a passionate journalist.,"Gandhi Godse Ek Yudh,Filmistaan,Chup,Eeb Allay Ooo!,Rangoon,Shor in the City"

3447364,Detective Byomkesh Bakshy!,Action Crime Drama Mystery Thriller Raj student finds lodging house opium gang factory party heroin convinced,Action Crime Drama Mystery Thriller Byomkesh Bakshy Calcutta Detective torn set Enter magical world nostalgia,"Synopsis as provided by Srijana Mitra Das in the Times of India :It's 1942 and Calcutta is ruled by the British Raj. Its underworld is ruled by Chinese gangsters smuggling opium from Shanghai. A vicious fight breaks out within one such gang at the Calcutta docks where gangster Yun Gong brutally blinds one rival and is then thought to be killed.Meanwhile, bright student Byomkesh Bakshy  is approached by Ajit Banerjee for help in finding his missing father Bhuvan babu. Initially, Byomkesh refuses and even suggests Bhuvan may be mixed up in dodgy business, at which Ajit angrily slaps him. The same day, Byomkesh's girlfriend Leela tells him she's marrying a well-placed chemistry student instead of him.Byomkesh seeks out Ajit and agrees to take his case. He visits Bhuvan's lodging home and meets Dr. Guha and Kanai Dao who legally sells opium. He also finds Bhuvan's beloved paan box is still in his room, hidden by his roommate who's oddly addicted to the paan masala. Byomkesh is convinced Bhuvan has been killed as his box and money are still in his room.Byomkesh visits the Sikdar chemical factory, now shut down, where Bhuvan used to work. There he sees film star Angoori taking a swim. She's amused by him and offers him a ride home. In the car, when he asks if she knows of Bhuvan, she pulls her handbag nervously to herself. In her studio, as she shoots, Byomkesh opens the bag and finds letters from cut-out newspapers, blackmailing the factory owner Sikdar babu, a friend of Angoori's.He's convinced Sikdar has killed Bhuvan when the latter tried to blackmail him. Byomkesh goes back to the factory with Dr. Guha and they pretend to the watchmen that they've come to fix a mouse problem. Poking around in the factory, they find Bhuvan's slashed, decomposed body stuffed into a machine.Sikdar is brought in by police commissioner Wilkie for questioning - but just then, Byomkesh discovers he's wrong and Sikdar is being framed as the newspapers only reach the lodging house at 8:30 AM every day while the blackmail letters were stamped at 7:30 AM at the post office, showing a false detail. Dr. Guha vanishes but sends Byomkesh a note, admitting he was blackmailing Sikdar, not Bhuvan babu.Sikdar is freed and Byomkesh follows him home but is detained by Angoori who tries to kiss him. He gently rebuffs her but when he goes to meet Sikdar, the latter is suddenly poisoned and dies. Suspicion falls on his rebellious nephew Sukumar who has opened a rival political party and is militant about India's freedom from the British. Sukumar's sister Satyawati pleads with Byomkesh to help her brother, who's driven off earlier in a cab used by Byomkesh.Byomkesh finds the Sardarji cabbie Sukumar drove off with, reaching a Japanese dentist Dr. Watnabe's clinic where the secretary says Watanabe is at the temple. Byomkesh and Ajit go to the temple, pretending they have a link with Sukumar's political party, but Watanabe is suspicious. Another member of Sukumar's party recognizes them and follows them at Watanabe's orders. Byomkesh and Ajit change their costumes and then follow the student back to the dentist's - where they find the secretary and student brutally murdered with a shadowy character escaping in a car.Byomkesh takes a paper out from the student's pocket - it's a map of Calcutta's river route. They return to the lodgers' house where Byomkesh feels low. He tries some of Bhuvan babu's paan masala and finds it is laced with heroin. Making a wall-painting of the entire crime, Byomkesh has the heroin presence confirmed by Leela's chemist husband who says this heroin is very hard to trace and made from opium - which Dao, who admits he's an undercover cop, tells Byomkesh has practically vanished from the city.Byomkesh finds there are two plots together here. The first is the Chinese gang warfare over opium, turned into untraceable heroin by Bhuvan babu's secret formula. The second is of Sukumar's political party being told by the Japanese army that they will land in Calcutta via its river routes and liberate the city from the British.The link between the two deadly plots is the mysterious Yun Gong.Meanwhile, Dr. Guha returns to the lodging house and tells Byomkesh he's a nationalist fighting for India's freedom. He offers Byomkesh a role to play in the struggle and says other peoples' murders are the price for this. Byomkesh asks Dao to take him to the Chinese gang which tells him about the deadly Gong. Byomkesh divulges all the facts to commissioner Wilkie and asks him to sound all the air raid sirens of Calcutta at 4 AM on Basant Panchami. He is convinced the Japanese will attack Calcutta through its river routes then and Gong will help them, so that they let him control the hugely rich opium trade.Byomkesh sends Dr. Guha a letter inviting him to the lodging house. Dr. Guha, Sukumar, Watanabe and Satyawati come there, as does Angoori who's told Byomkesh she's loved Gong from their days together in Rangoon and has been trying to mislead Byomkesh on Gong's orders. She hasn't seen him recently though and doesn't recognize him - not even when Byomkesh reveals Dr. Guha is actually the dreaded Gong.Angoori tries to stop Gong from helping the Japanese conquer Calcutta but he brutally murders her. The Chinese gang hidden by Byomkesh in the lodging house then attacks and takes away Gong who gets distracted by the air sirens going off. Byomkesh tells the Japanese doctor their game is up and the British army will crush their forces if they try to attack. He gives up.Byomkesh then tells Satywati he wants to marry her as the price for proving Sukumar's innocence. Meanwhile, Gong manages to kill the entire Chinese gang and escapes - promising Byomkesh revenge.","['Action', 'Crime', 'Drama', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']",Detective Byomkesh Bakshy is set in the 2nd World War torn Calcutta during the 1940s.

6129302,Bhavesh Joshi Superhero,Action Crime Drama Time water police people channel city starts video pipes show corruption identity house arts discovers martial,Action Crime Drama superhero country mask origin story sets fulfill slain friend clean reform training fight wearing,"Three young friends, Bhavesh , Siku  and Rajat  come up with a YouTube channel Insaaf TV, creating an online show about Insaaf  trying to expose to people some common wrongdoings and corruption which are rampant in the city. Initially, their show garners success, where they, wearing paper-bag masks, help to solve or confront some small scale corruptions in and around their neighborhood. Time soon flies; Siku and Rajat get jobs at corporate sector after passing out from college. Their interest for Insaaf TV gradually fades out except for Bhavesh, who gets obsessed about eradicating corruption from society and continues with his vigilante acts despite a fall in their channel viewership. He receives an email from an elderly citizen about water problems existing in and around his locality and starts investigating the case. He discovers that the water pipes across the city meant for delivering water to the households have been fitted with extra pipes to siphon out water to water tankers which are then delivered to the various neighborhoods making people buy the same water which they were supposed to receive for free from the municipality. Bhavesh leaks this news to his channel and this results in the water mafia Patil , responsible for this act, starting to look into the true identity of the masked man behind Insaaf TV.In the meantime, despite providing all the proper documents and doing multiple follow ups with the local police station, Siku's police clearance for his VISA processing to move to the US doesn't get approved until he pays bribe to the police officials to get the things done. Bhavesh becomes furious knowing this and they get initially engaged in a verbal tiff. An angered Bhavesh tells that all the govt. officials and politicians are corrupt and should be eradicated to cleanse the society with Siku recording his dialogues on his phone. Bhavesh punches Siku, breaking his nose. An enraged Siku uploads the video on Insaaf TV channel. Soon, Bhavesh is termed by the media as anti-national and unpatriotic. He is thrashed by the mob and then gets arrested thereby revealing his identity to Patil who warns him, but desperate to prove his innocence and uncover the truth to people, he sets out to gather evidence despite being injured. He gets caught in the process and Patil mauls him to death. The police hand over his body to Siku for last rites claiming it to be an accident and further warn him not to get involved into this. Blaming himself for Bhavesh's death, Siku tricks the police into believing that he has left for the US and takes refuge in an abandoned hotel which served as a safe house for their gang. He sets out covering his face in a mask and accidentally blows up Patil's pump house where he used to fill the siphoned water to the water trailers. It is then revealed that Patil has backing from the local political leader Rana .Siku gets himself a new vigilante costume, buys a motorcycle, customizes it by fitting nitro cylinders and interrogates govt. officer Subhash Mhatre  who reveals that Bhavesh was killed by Patil as he was about to uncover his illegal water supply activities. A fight breaks out between him and Mhatre's men during the interrogation and a nearly overpowered Siku is saved by Bhavesh's martial arts trainer. Siku posts his interrogation video in Insaaf TV and introduces himself as Bhavesh Joshi, still alive. He also starts learning martial arts and other combat techniques from the martial arts trainer. As the video goes viral, Patil gets arrested by police. However, Mhatre gets killed soon with police claiming it to be a suicide and that Mhatre has taken his own life out of guilt as he was forced to wrongly confess about Patil by Bhavesh. Patil is released due to lack of evidence. Siku disguises himself and visits the dance bar where Patil comes every night. He plants a bug in Patil's VIP room and gets to know that he is planning to blow up the water pipes across the city to create an acute shortage of drinking water. However, police inspector Sunil Jadhav  discovers him in the bar and after a long vehicular chase, a disguised Siku escapes, causing an enraged Patil to shoot a constable and forcing police to put the blame on Bhavesh.Suspicious about who is behind Insaaf TV after Bhavesh's demise, Rajat starts to keep an eye on Siku's girlfriend, Sneha  and discovers that he has not left India and has assumed the identity of Bhavesh Joshi. Siku arrives at the place targeted by Patil's men and fights them, later getting caught and unmasked in the process. They succeed in their mission to blow up the water pipes with an injured Siku watching in vain. Patil and Rana tell inspector Sunil to kill Siku and dump his body in water thus putting the blame on Bhavesh Joshi for this terrorist act against Mumbai. Sunil hesitantly shoots Siku. Getting to know of the location from his secret hideout, Rajat follows Siku and captures everything on camera. Once Siku is thrown into water, he rescues him and takes him to a hospital. However, Siku suggests him to let people think that he is dead and so Rajat admits him to the hospital under a fake alias of Mohan. As Siku recovers, Mumbai suffers from acute drinking water crisis. Rana meets the Chief Minister and tells him that he can arrange for water free of cost but instead should get the contracts of all future water related projects. Everyone gets drinking water for free and both the CM and Rana become heroes in common people's eyes.Rajat delivers the video of that night to Sunil Jadhav via a kid and forces him to open an investigation about the blast. As the true news spreads across the city Bhavesh Joshi starts gaining support and protests start everywhere. At night, Siku infiltrates Rana's house and takes out all his security guards.

Faced with the apathy of war-torn security forces and the looming fear of guerrilla attacks by communist rebels, he tries his best to conduct free and fair voting despite the odds stacked against him. He is disappointed when the voters do not turn up for the election. Later when a foreign reporter turns up at the polling station the security forces force the villagers from the constituency to turn up to cast their votes. When one of them enters the polling booth, he becomes bewildered with the voting machine and its operation.After talking to the lot, soon Newton realizes that they have no idea what the election is about. Some thought they would earn money from this, while others asked hopelessly about getting paid sufficiently for their work. He desperately tries to educate them but to no avail. Taking the lead, the frustrated security head pushes him aside and shames the villagers by telling them that these officers have risked their lives for their vote, and they should not turn them away, and that the voting machine is a toy; there are symbols of elephants, cycles, etc. and they could press any symbol they like . So while they vote their favourite symbol, instead of politicians they have never heard about, the foreign reporter gets a good news report about India's democracy.Newton wants to sit at the polling booth for the stipulated time but is forced to flee due to a Naxal ambush which he realises later was staged by the forces. On gaining such knowledge, he tried to outrun his escort team back to the polling booth, but gets caught on both sides, and is forcefully taken back to safety. On the way back Newton decides to collect votes of four villagers who suddenly turn up from deep inside the forest. The Chief of Security is reluctant to let them do so. It is here where the film gives the viewer the conundrum of the situation in war torn areas, through two men without any rivalry, bent on their duty, yet a stark difference, exposing the conundrum of truth. Taking his duty very seriously, Newton steals the Chief's gun and holds the officer at gunpoint till the villagers cast their votes. The chief comments out of frustration that it was not his wish to conduct such polling here in an area secured 6 months ago, having more landmines than men. He tells that he doesn't want to lose more brave boys like they already have anymore, even when the government cannot even supply them night vision goggles they have been asking for 2 years. Newton keeps him at gunpoint even after the voting for the remaining two minutes of his official duty . The security forces then beat him up out of frustration.The movie concludes with a shot of the area six months later, showing mining activity going on. The Chief of Security is shown shopping in civil dress suggesting his suspension/expulsion from army and indulging his wife and daughter over a bottle of olive oil, with the implication of the family facing a tough financial situation. Newton is shown in his office wearing cervical collar for his neck injury from the beating but happy otherwise keeping up with his old ways. He is visited by the local election officer Malko who asks him what happened after she left as she is unaware of the events and Newton asks her to tell everything over tea, but only after five minutes, when Newton's scheduled lunch break begins.","['Comedy', 'Drama']",A government clerk on election duty in the conflict ridden jungle of Central India tries his best to conduct free and fair voting despite the apathy of security forces and the looming fear of guerrilla attacks by communist rebels.,"Trahimam,Kathal: A Jackfruit Mystery,Sherni,Raid,Singh Saab the Great,Article 15"

Later Jasjeet's parents take him back to his village and thank Kundan for helping him. Kundan tries to redeem himself by taking Zoya to Jasjeet's village. However, he is devastated to find that Jasjeet has succumbed to injuries, finally making Kundan understand that his one-sided love has resulted in an innocent man's death. Kundan also forgets about his own marriage with Bindiya, which was supposed to happen the same day as that of Zoya and Jasjeet. For this reason, Kundan's family disowns him.Kundan then becomes homeless and begins visiting various religious places and volunteering in their activities so that he can atone for his sins. During one such visit to the banks of Ganga, a man advises him to do the right thing rather than running away from his sins.Motivated, Kundan locates Zoya to Jawahar Lal Nehru University, where she is spearheading the activities of the political party ""All India Citizen Party"" , created by Jasjeet. Kundan joins the nearby canteen and serves the people of the party, all the while trying to get Zoya's attention. Over time, Kundan becomes popular among the party due to his simple nature. In between Kundan also helps the party in negotiating some tough situations by using his simple yet witty tricks. Slowly, he emerges as a popular face of the party, disturbing Zoya. She holds a grudge that the person who is responsible for Jasjeet's death is now taking his place. She also tries to instigate party members against Kundan but Jasjeet's sister Rashmi , who is also Zoya's best friend, tells Kundan to continue, as he is the best choice for fulfilling Jasjeet's dreams.Kundan, however, only wants Zoya to forgive him. He silently follows Zoya's instructions despite them resulting in harm coming to him. The Chief Minister  tells Zoya she must seek revenge on Kundan so as to take the place Jasjeet/Akram held for the AICP. To get back the position, she tells her to let Kundan get injured as he delivers his campaign speech for the party. Zoya gets brainwashed by this plan and as the Chief Minister desired, Kundan is hurt badly and sent to ICU, thus fulfilling Zoya's revenge.Zoya slowly begins to understand the extent of Kundan's love and at a press meet following Kundan's injury, reveals that the plan was plotted by her and the Chief Minister. Zoya leaves the press meet in agony and finds out through a policeman that Kundan was aware of the plot and still let himself be injured. Shocked by this fact and ultimately realizing her love for Kundan, she rushes to the hospital to finally confess her feelings to him. However, Kundan dies.

3337550,Rahasya,Mystery Thriller police hotel daughter affair room body local relationship child killed portrayed played discovers,Mystery Thriller Doctor daughter stands accused killing sleuth innocence irrefutably aggrieved father protests evidence points wife suspects case concludes,"Remy Fernandes, portrayed by Ashwini Kalsekar, works as a housemaid in the luxurious duplex flat of Dr. Sachin Mahajan, played by Ashish Vidyarthi, in Mumbai. One day, while carrying a cup of tea, Remy knocks on the door of Ayesha, Dr. Sachin's 18-year-old daughter. Receiving no response, Remy enters the room to discover Ayesha's lifeless body on the bed. Frightened and shocked, she screams for Dr. Sachin and contacts the police. Dr. Sachin claims to have no recollection of the previous night due to his inebriation.

Dr. Aarti, Ayesha's mother, returns from Pune and is devastated by the news. During her conversation with the police, Remy mentions that the other household servant, Chetan, who has a criminal history, has gone missing since Ayesha's murder. Additionally, it is revealed that Ayesha was pregnant and had a boyfriend named Riyaz. Initial evidence leads the detectives to suspect Dr. Sachin, and he is taken into custody. The case is eventually assigned to Central Bureau Investigation Department Officer Sunil Paraskar, portrayed by Kay Kay Menon, who decides to conduct a fresh investigation as he remains unconvinced by the existing evidence.

In the course of his inquiry, Paraskar uncovers Dr. Sachin's extramarital affair with Brinda, played by Mita Vashisht, a former actress married to Dr. Hansal, Sachin's colleague. Hansal is aware of the affair and the frequent hotel stays by the couples. During one such incident, Hansal observes Ayesha and Riyaz at the same hotel. Sachin, who sees his daughter there, warns Ayesha to end her relationship with Riyaz. Despite the warning, Riyaz continues to sneak into Ayesha's house when her parents are absent. One night, Hansal, who lives in a nearby building, witnesses Riyaz entering Ayesha's house and deliberately informs Sachin. In a drunken rage, Sachin attacks Riyaz with a surgical knife, wounding his arm. Ayesha intervenes to protect Riyaz and accidentally injures her father, causing him to lose consciousness. In a panic, they move Sachin to his room and put him to bed. Afterward, Riyaz leaves, and Ayesha goes to sleep.

Paraskar is now convinced that Sachin is not the murderer. Brinda secures a prominent lawyer who successfully gets Sachin released on bail. Following the trial, Sachin expresses his desire for a divorce to Aarti and checks into a hotel with Brinda. Paraskar tracks down Riyaz, who has been in hiding since the murder. During the interrogation, Paraskar and Riyaz are attacked, and Riyaz is later found dead. Paraskar also discovers Chetan's body concealed within the floorboards of the Mahajan residence, further deepening the mystery. Soon after, Chetan's relative, Sudhakar Mishra, is also murdered. Paraskar subsequently questions Remy, uncovering that she had a previous romantic relationship and gave birth, contradicting her earlier claims of never being in a relationship. He meets her mother, who shows him a picture of a younger Remy, helping him connect the pieces of the puzzle and concluding the investigation.

At the hotel, Sachin's lifeless body is discovered, and local police conclude that he committed suicide due to guilt from the case. However, Paraskar remains skeptical and gathers Aarti, Remy, Brinda, Hansal, Riyaz's parents, and local police officers at the Mahajan residence, where Ayesha was killed. He discloses the shocking revelation that Ayesha was not Aarti's biological child but the daughter of Remy and Sachin. They had an affair when they were younger, but social differences prevented Sachin from marrying Remy, so he married Aarti instead. As Aarti was unable to conceive, they decided to adopt a child, with Sachin secretly bringing Remy's daughter home and hiring her as a full-time maid and nanny. As Ayesha grew, Aarti noticed the uncanny resemblance between her and Remy, ultimately realizing the truth. Seeking revenge, she plotted to frame her husband when the opportunity arose. Paraskar reveals that Aarti returned on the night of Ayesha's death, not the following day as she had claimed, and she was the one who killed Ayesha. She also murdered Chetan, who had witnessed her leaving Ayesha's room covered in blood. To complete her vengeance, Aarti pretends to serve Sachin with divorce papers and kills him. Finally, Paraskar discovers that Riyaz and Sudhakar Mishra were killed by a corrupt local policeman who was being bribed by Aarti. As Aarti is taken into custody, she smirks at a distraught Remy, satisfied with the knowledge that she has taken the lives of her child and lover.","['Mystery', 'Thriller']","A Doctor stands accused of killing his own eighteen-year old daughter.

Saraswati, also known as Saru, is a young person who works in a library. People think she looks ugly because of how she dresses and lives. Saru's sister, Kaveri, wants to get married, but their dad wants Saru to get married first. Kaveri's boyfriend gives her one month to decide if she wants to marry him or not.

1664809,Rakhta Charitra,Action Biography Crime Drama Thriller men kill killing police bus father starts local close Parishad contest people elections murder man,Action Biography Crime Drama Thriller family killer bandit decides politician order avenge deaths,"Nalla Narasimha Reddy , a local politician, is a powerful man in the area. His close associate, Gajula Veerabhadra , is his trustworthy ally for his political work, to the extent that Narasimha Reddy gives him the freedom to contest Jilla Parishad polls with his men. Veerabhadra champions the causes of the poor and oppressed, and they look up to him like their leader.

Nagamani Reddy , who is the local MLA of the district and close to Narasimha Reddy, becomes jealous of the budding trust between Veerabhadra and Narasimha Reddy, and starts poisoning Narasimha Reddy against Veerabhadra. Narasimha Reddy summons Veerabhadra and asks him not to contest the polls with his contestants, but rather support Nagamani Reddy's. Veerabhadra lashes out at Narasimha Reddy for being unfair to the underprivileged communities and storms out. Nagamani Reddy calls for Mandha, a close follower of Veerabhadra, and manipulates him into killing Veerabhadra, giving him the assurance that if he does it, people will suspect the policies of Veerabhadra as his own follower killed him and he will be the next in line as the leader of the poor people, else take his life. Mandha reluctantly agrees to it. Veerabhadra and his wife Gajula Jayalakshmi  travel in a bus with 40 people to a wedding. Mandha and Nagamani Reddy's men stop the bus, kill Veerabhadra's guards, and tell him to step out of the bus or else he will be killed along with the other innocents on the bus. Veerabhadra comes out, looking at Mandha, and dares him to kill. Nagamani Reddy's henchman Durga  shoots at Veerabhadra, making it look like Mandha shot at him; prompting Mandha about the deal he made with Nagamani Reddy, he tells him to kill him in front of everyone. Manda then kills Veerabhadra by crushing his skull with a boulder.

This results in an agitation led by Thota Shankar Ravi , who wants to avenge his father's murder by killing all the men of Nagamani Reddy and Narasimha Reddy. Enters Nagamani Reddy's son Bukka Reddy , a ruthless man who enjoys raping women and killing men in brutal ways. He starts killing Shankar's men in gory ways: drilling a hole into their skull, chopping off their heads with a sugarcane chopper, burning them alive, and feeding them to ravenous rats.

Pratap Ravi , who is in college in the city of Anantapur, gets the news of his father's murder and rushes to the village. Nagamani Reddy orders the local police inspector to kill Shankar in a fake encounter. When Pratap Ravi goes to the police station to ask about his brother, the inspector shows him Shankar's dead body and mocks him. Infuriated with his brother's murder, Pratap Ravi and Veerabhadra's men kill all the police officers and the inspector.

Pratap Ravi hides in the jungle with his father's associates and vows to kill Narsimha Reddy, Nagamani Reddy, and Mandha one by one, instilling fear of death in each one of them. He starts by busting into the house of Narasimha Reddy, killing his guards and finally killing him with a scythe in front of his wife as she looks on in horror. Next is Mandha; as he roams in the market, Pratap Ravi's men follow him, and before he can defend himself, they chop his hand off. Manda begs for his life, but Pratap Ravi stabs him in front of everyone. They plan to kill Nagamani Reddy, but they are cautious as there is heavy police security in his house. As Nagamani Reddy is sitting on his lawn conversing with a police officer, he is shot at by Pratap Ravi, who is dressed as the cop, and his men, dressed as cops as well, kill most of the policemen.

The story progresses as famed film star-turned-politician Konda Shivaji Rao  targets Anantapur for contesting elections. The day he enters Anantapur for the rally, Bukka Reddy's men throw bombs, which makes Shivaji Rao get back inside the car and go back. This insults him greatly, and he asks his secretary for the one who can stop Bukka Reddy. Immediately, his secretary mentions Pratap Ravi's name; Shivaji Rao sends for him and puts down a proposal of joining his party and ticket for contesting elections. On the other hand, Bukka Reddy makes his brother Puru Reddy  contest for elections and tries to sabotage the voting process by stealing the ballots. Pratap Ravi starts his rampage by eliminating, one by one, every rival of his party. Eventually, he comes across a man named Babu Qadri, who seeks Pratap Ravi's help in avenging his sister's death. Bukka Reddy had raped his 16-year-old sister, because of which she immolated herself, and Bukka Reddy had then broken Babu Qadri's leg. Pratap Ravi assures him his vengeance but asks him to forget everything for some time.

As Bukka Reddy's men fail in rigging the election process, Pratap Ravi wins by a majority. Immediately, Bukka Reddy is arrested. Puru Reddy gets him out on bail through Sirji's influence. Bukka Reddy, inflamed with the desire to avenge his father's death, hides out in an apartment with his men, and plots to kill Pratap Ravi. Pratap Ravi learns about his hideout and devises a plan to execute him. He immediately gathers his men and calls Babu Qadri, who had sought Pratap Ravi's help in avenging his sister, to lead the execution of Bukka Reddy. He calls for Bukka Reddy's servant and bribes him with 500,000 to aid in the execution. Babu Qadri and Pratap Ravi's men rush into the apartment, killing all of Bukka Reddy's men; then killing Bukka Reddy with an axe.","['Action', 'Biography', 'Crime', 'Drama', 'Thriller']",A killer bandit decides to become a politician in order to avenge deaths in his family.,"Satyagraha,Bullett Raja,Kochadaiiyaan,Raajneeti,Trahimam,Satyameva Jayate 2"

6826438,Parmanu: The Story of Pokhran,Action Drama History nucle tion wife Amb blind POTUS tellites spots nge fice tellite,Action Drama History Raina Ashwat test satellite spies teammates arrive re-conduct confidential nuclear face challenges local,"In the aftermath of USSR collapsing, India is left without any powerful allies while China continues to test its nuclear weapons and supply them to Pakistan. The year is 1995 and as the Chinese test their 43rd nuclear weapon. Scene changes to a board room meeting in the Prime Minister's Office where the bureaucrats are planning on how to criticize China for its actions when Ashwath Raina  proposes that India too test a nuclear weapon and become a nuclear state in his plan called nuclear peace. He is ridiculed and insulted by other board members and he walks out.The principle secy to the PM then half reads Raina's plan without even opening the floppy disc with all details and the attempt of testing the nuclear weapon in 1995 fails miserably with CIA spy satellites catching India 'Red Handed' which leads to India facing severe flak from USA. Raina is blamed for the failure and is dismissed from his office. Dejected, he moves his family to Mussoorie where he starts tuition for the aspirants of Indian Administrative Services. Its 1998 and its clear that Raina is still disturbed from the failure and his supportive wife Sushma  now worried about the future asks him to look for a permanent job.Himanshu Shukla , The Principle Secy to Shri. Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the new Prime Minister of India in 1998 takes office and is very serious about having a successful nuclear test done to put India on the nuclear map. He locates Ashwath Raina and sends him a letter offering a job in Delhi University and asking him to come for interview in a school in Dehradun. Upon reaching there Raina realizes that the job offer was just an alibi to keep the meeting a secret. It is here that Raina's initial plan is understood clearly and how it went wrong because in the hurry of nuclear test, no one paid any attention to the secrecy. His plan involves close knit operation of various Indian agencies like DRDO, ISRO, BARC, Armed forces and RAW.Raina is asked to lead a team of chosen scientist and engineers but his request for involving RAW is rejected outright. Amabalika Bandhyopadhyay  is in charge of security of the team which now comprises of Dr. Wiraf Wadia  from BARC, Dr. Naresh Sinha  from DRDO, Puru Ranganathan  from ISA  and Army Major Prem Singh . All 6 assume false identities as the 5 Pandavas and Krishna and head to Pokhran where they have made Pokhran fort as their base working as officers of Archaeological Survey of India.In the Pokhran range however all wear army uniforms so as to give a feel that its just a regular army operation. They are to use a pass code changed on a daily basis to enter the range. Puru Ranganathan is in charge of finding the blind spots - the time period when none of the Lacrosse spy satellites are looking over the range. It is decided that work on the shafts will be done only during the blind spots at night since day time the temperatures are high and there is a risk of sand storm affecting their work. Initially they have to drain out the water filled up in the shafts over the past 3 years. They put up a board as Water Service Cadres to hide their real intentions from the spy satellites.Meanwhile Sajjan, an ISI agent  is working closely with CIA agent Daniel  in getting leads towards the sudden increase in action in the range suspecting that India is getting ready for a nuclear test. The work of repairing the shafts and wiring is going on a good pace with covering up of their actions by erasing the Tire tracks using special contraptions and camouflage coverings and parking the vehicles in the same position giving an idea to the spy satellites that all is as it is. The nuclear material code named as Stores, is transported to Pokhran on 28th April about a month before the scheduled date of tests so as to weaponize them. As Raina is about to break the news about their progress to Himanshu Shukla, he is shocked to hear from him to stop further work. The reason we gather is the threat to the PM office from their allies who threatened to withdraw the support and dissolve the Government over various issues .Raina confronts Shukla about advancing the tests and completing them within the next 10 days much before the no confidence motion to be enacted in the Parliament, by saying they will have to work in both the day and night blind spots. Shukla disagrees and sends him away saying the conversation is over. A visibly dejected Raina comes to a Delhi School for his son's school admission and avoids his wife's questions over visiting his office in Delhi university where he is supposedly teaching . He hastily sends his wife and son back to Mussoorie and sees a SMS on his phone from Shukla giving him the go ahead. With a great smile he returns to Pokhran and coaxes his team to finish off preparations double time to complete the tests in the next 10 days. His team members are against this as they would need to work during day risking high temperatures and sand storms that would threaten to blow their cover.Nevertheless Raina is very serious on getting the tests done soon and makes his team agree. They are now working during day and all goes smooth and they are back in the hut much before the spy satellites are back in the range but a short sand storm blows away the sand covered over the wire cables and blows away their camouflage covering. Upon discovering that they have only 15 minutes to go back and make things 'normal' before the Lacrosse satellites are back on Pokhran range, they pace up and are able to return back to the base with seconds to spare despite a jammed wheel threatening to expose their position.Daniel realizes the lapse from CIA satellite centre in USA when he notices that one army jeep is parked in the opposite direction suggesting that it had moved but there are no tracks visible. He notifies this to the main CIA centre but they need more evidence on this. Daniel travels to Pokhran fort and tries to gather information by sweet talking with Puru Ranganathan and Dr. Naresh Sinha. Dr. Sinha inadvertently gives away the real name of Ashwath Raina which Daniel is happy to get. Sajjan in the guise of a telephone lineman taps into Raina's call to his wife and comes to know that he is hiding his work even from his wife. He then conspires with Daniel into leaking this information to his wife by falsely creating a misunderstanding that Raina is in Pokhran on a honeymoon package with his wife. Sajjan bugs Raina's room in the guise of a waiter and is almost caught but escapes.In the now bugged room, Raina is having a talk Ambalika as his wife knocks on the door. Raina is shocked to see his wife there. Ambalika leaves them to be together and in the argument that ensues over the misunderstanding that Raina is cheating his wife by lying to her about his job and location gives away the secret of blind spot. Sushma walks away asking him not to follow her. He however lets the situation as it is and stays there to oversee the tests. Daniel informs the CIA main centre to plug the blind spot by assigning another Lacrosse satellite to cover Pokhran from 2000 hrs that night.In the control room Raina and Ambalika are trying to figure out hard from where the information leaked to his wife. Meanwhile the countdown to the blind spot is almost there and Raina advises his team to begin work. Just as they are about to being, an overload on the generator snaps out the power and everything is shut. By the time they repair it, Raina spots the satellite in the night sky and is shocked beyond belief. Although the satellite sees everything as normal, the team considers the power outage as a blessing in disguise. They connect dots and come to a conclusion that their cover is probably blown with his wife reaching Pokhran and addition of another satellite. Himanshu Shukla advised to call off the tests and send back the stores leaving no paper trail as now the time of blind spots is severely inadequate to carry out their work in secret.The team is having a few drinks when suddenly Raina has another idea up his sleeve. He travels to Delhi and again talks with Shukla to create mock movement of armed forces along the Line Of Control making it look like preparation of war with Pakistan believing that such a sudden thing would force the CIA to shift their attention from Pokhran to the LOC. The gamble pays off as Lacrosse satellites are moved away from Pokhran much against Daniel's wish. Daniel faces severe flak from his boss Stephen  and is officially reassigned and asked to leave Pokhran immediately. This allows 8 hours of blind spots over the next 3 days in which the team now with renewed zeal finishes of their preparations and lowers the nuclear warheads in the shafts and proceeds to seal them. Meanwhile the informer to Sajjan gets arrested.On the test day, while having a meal with Daniel, Sajjan comes to realize that onions aren't available in the hotel and that all the onions have been sent to the army canteen. He tries to explain Daniel that all the onions have been used to pack the shafts. Daniel doesn't buy his onion absorbs radiation theory and asks him to stop the pursuit as he doesn't want to risk getting arrested now that Sajjan's informer has already been put behind bars. Sajjan on his own obtains Raina's phone with Vital information and hands it over to Daniel who in turn notifies CIA office in USA. They react with shock and disbelief when they come to know that India is ready to test more than 1 nuclear weapon anytime now. They quickly gather their data and are in the process of getting in touch with the POTUS to pressurize India to stop their tests.Meanwhile Sajjan and Daniel are arrested by Ambalika's team. Raina awaits final confirmation signed by the PM of India which Himanshu Shukla cleverly obtains on a coded draft while the PM is in a meeting with the American diplomat on the LOC issue. He immediately faxes the copy to the base in Pokhran where they begin their final countdown but have to wait further since wind direction is towards Pakistan and they don't want any risk of a leaking radiation to enter that country. The tense moment of wait intermingles with the tense moments of the CIA in USA who are trying their best to get in touch with the the POTUS. As the CIA chief opens the door to greet the POTUS, countdown reaches Zero time in Pokhran and India successfully tests 1 fusion and 2 fission bombs on the 11th of May 1998. Ambalika gives a look of victory to Daniel who had been ridiculing that POTUS already knows and that India will fail again. The team is elated and congratulating each other and shortly thereafter PM issues a statement about the successful tests. USA and the whole world is shocked to know that India carried out this operation with such precision and secrecy. CIA issues a statement that this was indeed a great failure of their intelligence.While India is celebrating its great success, it faces sanctions from the western world. on 13th May, two days after the initial tests, India tested two more fission bombs and joined the Nuclear club as declared itself as a full fledged Nuclear State. In the days to come, India earned the respect it deserved and continued to succeed and improve its relations with the nations world over. The movie ends with images from the original test as a mark of respect to the unsung heroes of the mission and honoring them by observing 11th May as National Technology day.","['Action', 'Drama', 'History']","Ashwat Raina and his teammates arrive in Pokhran to re-conduct a confidential nuclear test, where they face challenges from the American Lacrosse satellite and local spies.","Mission Majnu,India&apos;s Most Wanted,The Ghazi Attack,Modi Ji Ki Beti,Aiyaary,Bellbottom"

3043252,Parched,Drama village women husband money young badly people marriage girl friend time lot problems woman named men,Drama women difficulties arid landscape navigate personal cultural,"Parched is a story about four women who live in a desert village in India. Their village has a lot of problems, like old customs and traditions that treat women badly. Some of these problems include girls getting married when they are too young, families giving money or gifts to the groom's family when a girl gets married, husbands hurting their wives, and treating them badly both physically and mentally.

Rani is a woman who lost her husband and is having a hard time taking care of her old mother-in-law and teenage son, Gulab. In their village, it is customary to marry off young girls at a young age, so Rani pays a lot of money to marry Gulab to a young girl named Janki. However, Gulab is not behaving well. He is disrespectful, rebellious, and spends time with a group of friends who are not good influences. They even spend time with people who sell their bodies for money. Janki, the young bride, tries to stop the marriage by cutting off her hair, but she is still forced into the marriage. Lajjo is a friend of Rani who also lives in the same village. She is in a bad marriage with a husband who drinks too much alcohol and treats her badly. Lajjo is made fun of because she cannot have children, and people think she is not valuable because of it. The fourth woman is Bijli, who is a dancer in a traveling show. She gives advice and helps Rani and Lajjo with their problems.

The movie starts with two friends, Rani and Lajjo, going to visit a family in a different village. At the same time, a group of boys, including Gulab, are bothering a woman who has a job and knows a lot of things. Her husband, Kishan, comes to help her. While Rani is at her friend's house, she gets phone calls from someone she doesn't know. At first, the calls were a mistake, but then they started to be playful and flirty.

Later, at a meeting in the village, the people work together to solve problems. The first problem is about a girl named Champa who ran away from her husband and wanted to go back to her parents. But the meeting decides that she has to go back to her husband, even though she says his family hurts her. Kishan and his wife try to help, but people make fun of them for having different ideas. Kishan is a businessman who believes in equality and he hires women to work with him. The women tell the meeting that Kishan got a big job for their crafts and they want to save money for TVs. The older people reluctantly agree, but some men in the village, like Gulab, get angry because they don't like Kishan helping the women.

In a village, there are some men who believe in old-fashioned ways and are not very nice to women. Bijli, a woman who used to do a certain kind of work, is now saying no to those men. Her boss doesn't like this and wants to replace her with a younger girl named Rekha. Gulab, a man who is not happy in his marriage, has a lot of anger and treats women badly. He hurts Janki again and again. One day, Gulab and his friends get mad at Kishan and hurt him really badly. Kishan and his wife decide to leave the village because of this.

Bijli, Rani, Lajjo, and Janki were feeling upset, so they decided to visit a fort nearby. While they were there, Lajjo discovered that it might actually be her husband, not her, who cannot have children. As a test, Lajjo had a special connection with Bijli's friend and then became pregnant. When Bijli went back to her job, she found out that another person named Rekha was given her dancing spot. To earn money, Bijli did some really rough and scary things with different men.

Rani finds out that Gulab took her money and gets mad at him. He hurts Janki and then leaves in anger, leaving the women alone. The next day, Rani sells her house and pays off her debts. She helps Janki end her marriage so she can be with her old friend and keep going to school. Lajjo tells Manoj she's going to have a baby and he starts hurting her, showing that he knew he couldn't have kids. He accidentally falls into a fire and gets really hurt, while Lajjo watches. Rani, Lajjo, and Bijli decide to leave the village and look for a better life, away from all the sadness of old traditions and unfairness to women.",['Drama'],"In the arid landscape of Rajasthan, four women navigate their way through personal and cultural difficulties.","Jahaan Chaar Yaar,Lipstick Under My Burkha,Lust Stories,Queen,Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani,Begum Jaan"

7700730,October,Drama Romance hotel job friends hospital care visits plant family interns work staff members relationship starts,Drama Romance lives group interns usual grind suddenly accident protagonist obsessed lead love,"Shiuli Iyer and Danish ""Dan"" Walia work as interns at the same hotel. Shiuli, being very disciplined and responsible towards her job, is the polar opposite of Dan who is careless and irresponsible towards his job. At the beginning of the story, Dan struggles with his job serving various departments of the hotel. He doesn't seem to have a very good relationship with his fellow staff members except for two of his friends who work at the same hotel as interns.

On New Year's Eve, Shiuli and her friends party on the 3rd floor of the hotel, when Dan is nowhere to be found. Shiuli accidentally slips off and is hospitalized. While other members of the hotel staff visit her at the hospital, Dan gets seriously affected when his friends tell him that Shiuli's last words just before her fall were ""Where is Dan?"". Dan starts visiting the hospital every day, despite that negatively affecting both his job and his relationship with his friends who cover his shifts and help him financially. After a scuffle at the hotel, Dan is terminated. He finds comfort being with Shiuli who slowly starts to improve and Dan's mere presence calms Shiuli. He devotes his entire time to taking care of her.

Seeing Dan's career and personal life drowning due to his devotion towards Shiuli, her mother Vidya decides to make him go and take care of himself. Dan joins another hotel in Kullu as manager but is unable to take his mind off Shiuli. Soon he learns of Shiuli's failing health and visits the hospital. He apologises for leaving her abruptly and promises to stay with her. Seeing Dan, Shiuli calms and begins to improve again. She is soon discharged from the hospital and is brought home where Dan continues taking care of her. He takes her to a park and asks her why she remembered him before her fall. Shiuli responds by trying to say his name aloud. The following night Shiuli suffers a seizure and dies as her lungs collapsed. Emotionally broken, Dan visits Shiuli's home and comforts her despaired family. Afterwards, he is seen collecting her death certificate tearfully.

In a later scene, Vidya tells Dan that she was named Shiuli because of her fondness for the shiuli flower, which she loved collecting as a child with her grandfather. She further remarks how shiuli flowers are short-lived, as they live all night and die by dawn; to which Dan sorrowfully points out, her daughter too, was short-lived like her namesake flowers.

Several months later, Dan is rehired by the hotel where he completes his diploma and works as a sous chef. One day, he notices several missed calls and visits Vidya. They sit in the backyard discussing Shiuli. Pointing at the shiuli plant in the backyard, Vidya tells Dan about her family shifting to their hometown Trichy. She doesn't wish to leave Shiuli's plant, but Dan assures her that he would take care of it.

As the story ends, Shiuli's family has moved and Dan carries the shiuli plant with him, as a symbol of the unconditional and unconventional love which had blossomed in his heart for Shiuli.","['Drama', 'Romance']",A group of interns are going through the usual grind when suddenly an accident changes their lives.

2621000,Jolly LLB,Comedy Crime Drama Dew court Trip judge hul medi tion fter ccident Due evidence died,Comedy Crime Drama lawyer Wanting fortune infamous earn fame small time files learns,"At the start of the film, a group of rich brats are shown driving their imported Mercedes at dangerous speeds in a drunken state during late hours. As they are driving, they come across another similar youngster drink-driving. They engage in a verbal duel and subsequently race with their cars. At one curve the youth runs out of his luck and loses control of his Land Cruiser and consequently crashes into the foot-path.
Cut to Uttar Pradesh District court where an advocate Suresh Vashishth , who also doubles as an Astrologer, gains a client - who seems to be a thug waiting for bail - by saying that his current Lawyer Girdhar Sharma has a habit of forgetting the names of his client.Enter Jagdish 'Jolly' Tyagi  a Defence lawyer who attempts to get his client, Dr. Harphool bail on the pretext of the judge's birthday and states that media fabricated the entire incident involving Dr. Harphool's son operating a pregnant woman for the sake of a Guinness Book of World Records entry. Mahesh Gupta, the PIL filer opposes this by showing the photos taken with Dr. Harphool's cell phone. Upon hearing this Dr. Harphool loses his cool and admits that his boy operated the woman. Due to this false move, the judge postpones his bail.Disappointed Jolly loses hope in Meerut and decides to move to Delhi, in search of a better clientele where his Brother-In-Law lives even after much persuasion by his friend Sandhya  to remain persevere.
But the situation gets even worse in Delhi where Jolly, in order to make a living, poses as an apprehended terrorist in front of the media for Rs. 1000. While in Delhi, Tyagi comes to know of the Land Cruiser Hit-and-run case involving Rahul Dewan, son of Billionaire Yograj Dewan , whose defense lawyer is the much respected 'star' litigator Tejinder Rajpal . During the trial, the strong Rajpal brings to light the fact that 7516 road accidents occurred in Delhi, while the newspapers of the past 6 months only seem to highlight the occurring of 1 accident. Thus, Rajpal successfully gets Rahul Dewan acquitted due to lack of evidence, eye-witnesses and the so-called 'Land Cruiser', claiming that his client was being victimized by the media due to the fact that he was from a rich family.In the aftermath of the court judgment, Jolly, after being inspired by the media backlash, files a PIL in the court regarding the case. When Judge Tripathi's  questions the filing of a PIL despite the issuance of a sentence earlier, Jolly, along with Vasu , mentions media reports about the police presenting tampered facts and leaving out critical evidences. He gets a rescheduling of the hearing after getting rebuked for failing to provide evidence, citing media reports and for making spelling mistakes in the PIL like 'apple' instead of 'appeal' and 'prostitution' instead of 'prosecution'.Jolly, heartbroken after the incident, stays back late. A person named Albert Pinto  approaches him, claiming to be an eye-witness who was present while the accident took place at the night of 20 April and who also saw Rahul Dewan. He provides Jolly with a copy of the police complaint he filed along with the ticket of the film after watching which he was returning to his hotel and testifies in the court. As a result the court asks Rahul Dewan to appear again. Jolly gains overnight media recognition and an office from Kaul Saab  whose daughter was forced upon and murdered by a cop's son but later walked free due to Rajpal's exploitation of the loop holes present in the judicial system.Albert Pinto actually is Tejinder's man and wants more money from the Dewan's. Albert Pinto tells Jolly that he will turn against him and not identify in court saying that a deal has been stuck with Dewan's for 2 Crores and Jolly will get 20 Lakhs . He accepts the offer and tells Sandhya this who gets angry at him.Kaul Saab comes to know the next day that Jolly has taken the money from Tejinder and slaps him. Jolly realizes his mistake and decides to fight and win the case. He searches for evidence and with the help of his Brother in Law finds a video which has the recording of the day of the accident. Jolly presents this video in court and Tejinder says that this was driven by the Driver of the Dewans'. Jolly does not lose hope and finds an eye witness but he is reluctant to come to court but tells him to stop searching in New Delhi and search in Gorakhpur where he will find the evidence.The day of the hearing, Jolly questions SI Rathi whether he did the investigation honestly and diligently and asks him to read out loud the names of the 6 who died. Jolly claims that in reality only 5 people died and seeks permission to present the sixth one who apparently died as a witness without prior notice. Rajpal vehemently objects but Judge Tripathi overrules his objections.A Burkha clad Sadakanth Mishra enters the court and recognizes Rahul Dewan as the driver of the Land Cruiser which killed his 5 acquaintances and rendered him a cripple. He also states that SI Rathi left him after taking his yearlong savings of Rs. 30,000 and gold ornaments meant for his sister's wedding. Rajpal asks for a rescheduling but Judge Tripathi does not comply. During the lunch time, SI Tripathi calls Pinky to bring the man he captured, who turns out to be one Ramakanth Sukhla. When the court resumes, Rajpal claims that the police investigation was 'botched' up since it stated that 6 people died in an accident by truck while the prosecution claims that 5 died in an accident by a car. He recommends that the strongest action be taken against SI Rathi as evident from the Prima Facie and questions whether the court should be sending Rahul Dewan to jail on the basis of a botched up investigation. He jokingly adds that foot-paths are not commissioned by Government for sleeping.Jolly, in his submission, agrees with Rajpal that foot-paths are not for sleeping and rhetorically asks why these poor, deprived of work, shelter and food come to tarnish the beauty of the metros. He adds, however, that they do have one right: the right to obtain Justice; one that is given to them by the Constitution of India. Infuriated, Jolly states that if the case lingered any longer, Rajpal would certainly prove that Sadakanth Mishra was Shah Rukh Khan while a train caused the accident, and due to lack of evidence the court would have to comply. He states that foot-paths are not for driving either. This was the 'joke' and he adds that Judge Tripathi's reputation was at stake.Judge Tripathi says that there are two aspects to the case. The first one was that SI Rathi was to be suspended with immediate effect and an investigative process be started against him. The second one was the manipulation of facts, which would be necessary only if Rahul Dewan was guilty. The judge dishearteningly admits that in spite of being fully aware of who committed the crime, he is rendered helpless due to the lack of substantial facts as evidence which are, as evident, prudently kept at bay by the ones whose interests are at stake. He also adds that he was determined to make this one an exception even if it meant exploiting his chair to some extent. He was least bothered to notice whether he would be set free in the impending legal battle.As a result, the court finds Rahul Dewan guilty and sentences him seven years of imprisonment under Indian Penal Code 304. Thus, Jolly wins the case and his self-respect and is congratulated by all and sundry","['Comedy', 'Crime', 'Drama']","Wanting to earn fame and fortune, a small time lawyer files a PIL for an infamous hit-and-run, and thus learns what it really is like to be a lawyer.","Jolly LLB 2,My Client&apos;s Wife,Singham,Raat Akeli Hai,Gumraah,Pink"

9098938,Sharmaji Namkeen,Comedy Drama Family Vincy time flat son home Sandeep Vinayak newfound revelation family deal events friend ring finds,Comedy Drama Family man light hearted coming age lovable story,"Brij Gopal Sharma, affectionately known as Sharmaji, finds himself at a crossroads as he's asked to retire by his employer, Madhuban Home Appliances, at the age of 58. An energetic and lively man, Sharmaji shares his small home in Subhash Nagar, West Delhi, with his two sons, Sandeep ""Rinku"" Sharma and Vinayak ""Vincy"" Sharma. Rinku is in a relationship with his colleague Urmi Kaul, and they have plans to purchase a flat in Gurgaon after their marriage. Vincy, on the other hand, is a final-year B.Com student with a deep passion for dance. Sharmaji, however, is reluctant to leave his cherished home of many years, which creates a situation where Rinku decides to keep his apartment deal a secret.

Determined to overcome his newfound sense of boredom, Sharmaji embarks on various hobbies and even explores part-time job opportunities. He reluctantly delves into cooking for kitty parties after a suggestion from his childhood friend, Chaddha, who introduces him to an acquaintance, Manju Gulati. During one of these gatherings, Sharmaji impresses the attendees with his culinary skills and befriends Veena Manchanda, a boutique owner who lost her husband in a car accident three years ago. This connection leads to more opportunities, and Sharmaji finds himself catering for numerous events. He even crosses paths with Veena's friend, Robbie Sachdeva, a prominent politician, and lends his culinary expertise to a religious gathering at Robbie's residence.

However, a turning point occurs when a video of Sharmaji dancing at a kitty party surfaces during a family gathering for his birthday. Rinku and Vincy are embarrassed and furious at the revelation. A heated argument ensues, during which Vincy exposes Rinku's plan to move out and Rinku divulges that Vincy failed his exams. This revelation leaves Sharmaji devastated, but he remains committed to his newfound passion.

Sharmaji's bond with Veena deepens over time, as they continue to share moments at the kitty parties. They become close friends, sharing personal stories and experiences. One day, they overhear Rinku engaged in a heated argument with the flat builder, Jain, over their prospective Gurgaon flat. Rinku lies to them, claiming that everything is on track. That night, during a meeting with Urmi's parents, Sharmaji discovers that Urmi's father possesses more knowledge about the flat deal than he does. On the way back home, he confronts Rinku, who confesses that he paid a substantial amount as a token deposit for the flat and that Jain is delaying possession. Sharmaji is stunned by the revelation that his son spent such a significant sum without informing him, prompting him to reconsider his catering hobby and focus more on family matters.

Rinku visits a municipal office and learns that Jain constructed the flats on illegally acquired land. He is advised to retrieve his token deposit and withdraw from the deal. When Rinku confronts Jain, who refuses to respond to his calls, a confrontation leads to Rinku's arrest. Sharmaji, at the time, is attending a kitty party when he receives a call informing him of his son's arrest. He rushes to the police station with the ladies from the kitty party, leading to a comical series of events. Sharmaji, coincidentally, has a phone with him inside the cell, thanks to Veena's assistance through hand signals. They manage to contact Robbie, who uses his influence as the Mayor of West Delhi to secure their release.

3495030,Dum Laga Ke Haisha,Comedy Drama Romance family married wife dad toge wanted race named things country group aunt wedding make test place,Comedy Drama Romance Prem wife oversized supposed spend lifetime mismatch regular arranged marriage turn perfect,"In 1995, there was a young man named Prem who owned a store that rented video tapes. He was a member of a group that loved their country a lot. Every day, he would go to a special place with other members to say the national anthem, promise to be loyal to their country, and do exercises. One of the important things the group believed in was not doing things that are bad for you. The older members were married, but they were expected to not let their married life get in the way of serving their country. Prem's dad wanted him to marry a girl named Sandhya who was educated but overweight. Even though Prem didn't really like her, he agreed to marry her because he didn't think he could find a girl as pretty as a famous actress named Juhi Chawla. Also, Sandhya wanted to be a teacher, so Prem's family thought that marrying her would help their family financially. Finally, in a big wedding with lots of people from their community, Prem and Sandhya got married.

Prem is not interested in getting married and doesn't want to be intimate with his new wife, Sandhya. He leaves to go somewhere else, while his sister, aunt, and mother argue about his lack of a life. Sandhya tries to make Prem like her, but he feels too embarrassed to even be seen with her in public. Their relationship is not good, even though they kiss and have sex on their second night together. Someone tells Prem that since he couldn't keep his promise to not have sex, he should focus on being a good husband instead. Sandhya gets more and more frustrated, and when Prem's aunt brings up a small issue, they argue and she tells everyone that he doesn't treat her well.

One day, Prem and his friend Nirmal go to a wedding together. But during the wedding, Prem drinks too much and gets jealous of Nirmal's pretty wife. He says mean things about his own wife, Sandhya, in front of everyone. Sandhya hears this and gets upset, so she slaps Prem. In the morning, Sandhya thinks about what happened and decides she doesn't want to be with Prem anymore. She blames his dad for not teaching him to respect women. Sandhya's mom tries to make her go back to Prem, but she wants to live on her own. Meanwhile, Prem realizes he needs to focus on his studies, so he decides to retake an English test. His friends get mad at him and kick him out of their group. Prem studies hard, but when it's time for the test, he feels too overwhelmed with emotions and can't write anything. In the end, he writes a sad message on his test, saying that if the person grading it has any sympathy, they shouldn't give him a zero, or else he might try to hurt himself.

Once upon a time, Nirmal's dad opened a music CD shop in the same place where Prem's family had their own business. This made Prem's family worried because it affected their business. Prem's family talked to Nirmal's family about it and they had a discussion. In the end, Nirmal challenged Prem to a contest where he had to carry his wife on his shoulders and run through an obstacle course. At the same time, Sandhya and Prem went to court to ask for a divorce. Sandhya told the court that she married Prem because she really liked him, but Prem admitted that he only married her because his family wanted him to. Prem's dad asked the judge not to make them get a divorce and said that they would be happy to have Sandhya stay with them. Sandhya's parents agreed with Prem's dad. The judge decided that Sandhya and Prem should try to fix their marriage by spending six months together. Even though they only agreed to live together as a formality, they started to understand each other better and get along. Meanwhile, Sandhya was forced to participate in the contest. Sandhya wanted Prem to take her to the contest, but he was too confused to think clearly. As the days went by, Sandhya and Prem started to become closer, but according to Prem, they didn't work well together and were very different from each other.

One day, a man named Prem came home and was upset to see that his family was pretending to like the food that his wife, Sandhya, made. The food was plain and didn't have any spices. He was so sad that he wanted to hurt himself, but then a police officer came because he had written a letter about his feelings. Sandhya felt sad for Prem and they talked honestly about their feelings. They realized that they might not be perfect for each other, but they still cared about each other a lot. Sandhya got a job offer in another city and she was happy to accept it because she thought no one cared about her anymore. When she told Prem about it, he realized that he loved her and didn't want to lose her.

On the day of a race, Prem's aunt convinces him to join even though he didn't want to. This was important because Prem's parents were having problems and this race was their last chance to fix things. To everyone's surprise, Prem carries his wife on his back and races ahead of everyone else. During the last part of the race, Sandhya tells Prem that she doesn't want to go to a certain place and wants to stay with him instead. Prem knows that if he wins the race, Sandhya can stay, so he pushes himself even harder and ends up winning.

After the race, Prem doesn't want Sandhya to leave his side. He carries her all the way to his house and they show their love for each other with a kiss.","['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Romance']",Prem and his oversized wife Sandhya are supposed to spend a lifetime together.

Not only that, but their whole team has a nickname - CHILLAR PARTY.They explain that they have mainly two enemies with the ""over-sized"" neighboring cricket team to whom they always lose, and a dog to whom they have given a name - Loose Motion, since it has a tendency to make messes. So they develop an enmity against dogs. They were mourning and complaining about the dog when Lucky Singh nicknamed as Panauti , says that ""Don't worry, no other dog will ever enter our society,"" everybody loses hope.Their hopes are shattered shortly after a boy - Fatka who was employed for washing the cars of the society, enters with his dog Bhidu. They do everything to throw the boy and his dog out, plant fake dog poop all over the society, steal Phatka's wash cloth, even hide Bhidu, but become unsuccessful. Eventually they develop a friendship with each other as Phatka helps them by serving as the lead bowler during the match with the neighboring cricket team. The Chillar party parents object to Phatka when their kids learn the rustic language from him. But they all forgive & adopt Phatka as part of their lives when Phatka helps a feminine voiced member of the society, struggling to get a job, by suggesting that he gets a job on radio.But their happiness is short-lived when a reckless politician, Bhide, enters their life after his personal secretary is attacked by Bhidu for having hurt Phatka. Bhide is a close associate of Chandan Nagar Secretary Mr Tandon. Tandon hates the Chillar Party for good measure.
Bhide announces that in a news telecast, all the stray dogs roaming about in residential buildings in Mumbai will be caught and terminated and gives an excuse that it is done so that Mumbai becomes safer, and declares the slogan as ""Safe Mumbai and Safe Mumbaikar"". He further informs that the dog can only be saved if the society files a NO OBJECTION CERTIFICATE within 1 month. Tandon promises Bhide that Bhidu will not be part of the Chandan Nagar society, as NOC will not be issued. Chillar party, shocked by this, strives hard to get the NOC, wherein they have to get at least more than 50% votes of the total residents in the society i.e. 31 votes. But they manage only ten votes after 15 days.To get votes they use their radio connection to advertise the news of a talking dog. A reporter arrives & next day Bhidu & Chillar Party make the news. Bhide responds by threatening Tandon with jail over employing child labor in Phatka. Tandon fires Phatka, but the kids employ Phakta to clean their cycles & pay him from pocket money. To get more votes, they organize a CHADDI MARCH, marching the streets with nothing on their body except underwear. They are telecast on TV and this gets them 10 more. With more hard work and awareness they manage to get another 10 votes counting a total of 30 votes. Only 1 day remains to complete the deadline of 1 month as declared by Bhide. Whilst all this chaos is going on, a t.v channel invites Bhide and the Chillar party for an interview. Seeing this as their last chance, they attend the interview which is being telecast to the whole India.Knowing that that is the last day and dog catchers are after Bhidu, they pray hard to save him. During the interview they are constantly mocked by Bhide and asked if all these dirty tricks and uncultured techniques were taught to them by the textbook. As he asks to stop the telecast, Silencer, who doesn't speak at all, speaks for the first time. He opens his text book and reads out loud ""We must always help others"" followed by others reading out ""A friend in need is a friend indeed"" and ""We must do what is right"". Overwhelmed by this the whole audience gives them a loud round of applause.Whilst in the society, dog catchers are already searching for Bhidu. The paper containing 30 votes is before the secretary, Mr. Tandon while he's watching the telecast. He resents Chillar party and is a close associate of minister Bhide. He was asked by to give away Bhidu since this issue originated in his society. Chillar party pleads to leave and the interviewers agree. When they reach the society, they are disheartened as there is no sight of Bhidu. Suddenly Bhidu comes jumping in, wearing a collar reading ""Bhidu, Chandan Nagar Society"".

Her condition causes her to make uncontrollable sounds likened to hiccups. Although she has been unsuccessful for the past 5 years in landing a teaching job, she is supported in her ambitions by her mother  and her younger brother . It is revealed that her father  divorced her mother several years earlier, which is why Naina's relationship with him is strained. During her childhood, she was expelled from multiple schools and would witness her parents arguing about whether she is normal or special. One day, Naina receives an offer to teach at the prestigious St. Notker's School, a job which she had applied to 5 times before. When asked why she was so persistent for the particular school, Naina explains that she herself graduated from St. Notker's and was inspired by Mr. Khan , a former principal. He had believed in her and announced that she would never be expelled for being different. Naina's unwavering confidence impresses the current school committee and they assign her to 9F, a new class section. It is revealed that the school was desperate to hire her as all other teachers had failed to get the class to cooperate. Naina notices that the students are unruly, misbehaved and are visibly different. Shyamlal, the school's peon , discloses to her that the 9F students belong to families from a nearby slum and that they were given admission to fill the government-prescribed quota for the underprivileged.On the first day of class, Naina's students imitate her sounds and mock her. She decides to teach them in an interactive way, determined to show resilience when dealing with the class. The students prank her with liquid nitrogen and this causes a mild explosion that shatters the classroom windows. Naina prevents the class from being expelled by taking the blame and saying that it was a badly executed chemistry example. Mr. Wadia , the teacher of class 9A, strongly dislikes the 9F students. His class is composed of student prefects, who are academically excellent. Naina challenges Mr. Wadia that students from 9F will earn the prefect badges as well. The school's annual Science Fair project is assigned to 9A, who are prevented from mingling with 9F by Mr. Wadia. They yearn to experience the interactive experiments that 9F gets to partake in but Mr. Wadia dismisses them as inferior to textbook learning. Meanwhile, 9F warms up to Naina and begin wholeheartedly participating in class; she teaches them to be brave in their pursuit of knowledge and helps them realize their individual strengths. Aatish , the sole student who remains cold towards Naina, secretly sabotages 9A's project in his vengeance. This is discovered by Mr. Wadia and the Principal  decides to expel the 9F class. Once again, Naina prevents this by promising that the class will pass their final exams, but she is unable to prevent their suspension from attending school till the exams. Dejected, she tells her students that they have shattered her attempt to help them. Aatish's classmates help him realize his mistake and he publicly expresses regret, promising Naina that the class has realized her value.All of 9F studies diligently for their exams, with Naina helping them during her off-duty hours. Shyamlal supplies Aatish copies of the wrong question paper so they would fail, but when he presents them to his classmates, they refuse to cheat and he gives up on the idea as well. Exam results prove Naina's promise as the 9F students pass successfully, with two of the students even achieving first rank. However, the class is accused of cheating as Shyamlal confesses of supplying question papers, and the Principal decides to publicly expel them during the prefect pinning ceremony. Prior to the event, one of Mr. Wadia's students reveals that he bribed Shyamlal into supplying the wrong question papers, and he realizes that 9F did not cheat. Mr. Wadia takes to the stage and announces the he, himself, wrongfully tried to fail the students. He then applauds Naina's trans-formative teaching and asks her to pin the prefect badge to her students which ranked first. She later tells him that she doubts that he bribed Shyamlal. Mr. Wadia smiles and says that he doubts she caused a liquid nitrogen explosion. With the combined efforts of 9A and 9F, the Science Fair project is rebuilt and wins the competition. After that she served to the school, St.Notker for 25 years and attained success and prestige. After 25 years, Naina is shown to be the Principal, and she narrates that she is finally retiring from teaching. As she walks out of the school, the school's students praise her and bid farewell. The last to happily bid her are the students of 9F who are now successful adults.","['Comedy', 'Drama']","Suffering from Tourette Syndrome, Naina gets assigned a class of defiant students and must ensure that her students realise their potential.","A Thursday,Chalk N Duster,Shimla Mirchi,Bamfaad,Chhalaang,Rashmi Rocket"

6299040,The Ghazi Attack,Action Thriller War submarine ship called Captain attack people water torpedoes crew torpedo big fight mines,Action Thriller War submarine port plans attack secretly past,"In 1971, India and Pakistan were very close to starting a big fight with each other because lots of people were leaving their homes and going to different places. The Indian Navy and a special group called RAW found a secret message from Pakistan that was about possibly attacking an Indian ship. They thought the ship they might attack was called INS Vikrant, which was India's only big ship with planes on it. The people in charge of the Navy sent a submarine called S21, led by Captain Ranvijay Singh, to go and gather information. They also sent Lt. Cmdr Arjun Varma with Captain Singh to make sure he didn't do anything to start a war with Pakistan.

The Navy's leaders find out that the Pakistan Navy has sent a ship called PNS Ghazi to the Bay of Bengal to fight against a ship called Vikrant. As a distraction, Ghazi attacks an Indian merchant ship. Another ship called S21 quickly goes to where the attack happened. One of the people on S21 named Arjun sees that there are still some people alive in the wreckage of the merchant ship. He jumps into the water and saves a little girl and a woman who are refugees from Bengal. While S21 is watching, they hear a sound from Ghazi using a special tool called sonar.

Singh thinks they need to find Ghazi and attack, but Arjun disagrees and reminds him of his directions. Singh then tells Lt. Commander Santosh Devraj to practice shooting at Ghazi, even though Arjun objects. They shoot a torpedo, but it doesn't hit Ghazi and lets them know they are there. Razak, who is on Ghazi, realizes the enemy is nearby and tells his crew to go quickly to Visakhapatnam Port and set up mines to try and destroy S21.

S21 is following the same path as Ghazi, but they suddenly see that there are dangerous mines ahead. Singh and Arjun try really hard to change the direction of the submarine, but one of the mines explodes and breaks a lot of important parts of the submarine. This causes many holes in the submarine and the front part where the torpedoes are kept gets filled with water. This makes the submarine unable to shoot its torpedoes. Singh sadly dies while trying to save Arjun, and the submarine sinks to the bottom of the sea.

Arjun is now in charge of the submarine. He and his team work together to fix the leaks and get rid of the extra water. They say goodbye to Singh, who is leaving. They realize that the submarine can only move up and down, not sideways. They can't catch the Ghazi submarine, so they trick it by setting off a mine nearby. The enemy captain, Razak, thinks the submarine is still working and tries to sink it. Arjun and Devraj have a plan to get the Ghazi submarine in their firing range, but Razak gets suspicious and changes his submarine's direction at the last minute.

Ghazi, a submarine, tries to attack another submarine called S21. But S21 is able to avoid the torpedoes fired by Ghazi by moving up and down in the water. This makes Ghazi's captain, Razak, very frustrated. S21 goes deeper into the water than it's supposed to, to hide from Ghazi's sonar. Even though it uses up a lot of its battery power, S21's crew members sing patriotic songs to make Ghazi even more angry and provoke it to attack again. Razak orders Ghazi to fire more torpedoes at S21. To do this, Ghazi has to turn around. One of S21's crew members, Arjun, goes into a flooded part of the submarine to manually launch torpedoes at Ghazi. He succeeds in doing so, but at the same time, Ghazi also launches a torpedo. Ghazi's torpedo misses S21, but S21's torpedo hits Ghazi and destroys it, killing everyone on board. S21 then comes up to the surface, and the crew saves Arjun just in time. Later, a Navy ship from India comes and helps S21.

After Ghazi sank, people were not sure what really happened. Some say a ship called INS Rajput caused it. The sinking of Ghazi made India and Pakistan fight a big war. In the end, India won and Pakistan had to give up. This war also led to the creation of Bangladesh.

Popular for crimes like rape, murder, and extortion, he ruled the village for around 13 years till he was killed by a mob of women . Since the police had turned a blind eye as they were happy with the money that was coming their way, Yadav committed crime even in the daylight. Out of fear, villagers did nothing about it. Women suffered the most as they were gangraped every now and then, sometimes even in crowded places, in full public view – from pregnant women to minor girls, no one was spared by Yadav and his gang. He would even pick women from their homes to rape them. He once brutally killed a young woman in front of her teenage daughter. The woman was dragged out of her house while the family was having dinner and stabbed to death. Her fingers and ears were then chopped to take off her rings and earrings. There was a woman he raped right after her wedding and then there was another who was raped a few days after giving birth. All of this was happening in front of the families and villagers – rape, murder, torture, extortion – every crime had spectators. Neither did police stop him nor could the families save their loved ones. 

Fast forward to Usha Narayane, a young woman, who wasn’t living in Nagpur for a long time, had returned to the village. An educated, working woman who couldn’t tolerate this nonsense filed a police complaint against Akku Yadav after he threatened to murder her friend’s family and the friend refused to do anything about it. When Yadav came to know about the complaint, he along with 40 other men surrounded Narayane’s house with an acid bottle and threatened to throw acid on her before raping and killing her. As nothing worked against him, this young woman turned on the gas cylinder and threatened Yadav to kill everyone gathered around her house including herself by lighting a matchbox. 


Seeing one woman’s brave stand and fight against a gang of criminals, the villagers stood for her, chased Yadav, and burnt down his house. Akku Yadav then ran to the police for protection. To save him from the angered mob, the police arrested him. He was not only safe but seemed like he was having the time of his life in custody. While he was being presented in the court, he once again threatened a woman saying he would rape her as soon as he comes out of the jail to which the police laughed. The rest is history.

A mob of 200-400 women entered the courtroom and brutally murdered Akku Yadav. His penis was chopped off, his fingers were found in some other corner of the courtroom. The women passed the knives to each other so that most of the women could get a chance to stab him. He was stabbed around 70 times that day. After the incident, the women celebrated Akku Yadav’s death and took complete responsibility of murder. 
Police then tried to shut the case by randomly picking and jailing 5 women from the village including Usha Narayane who wasn’t even present when the lynching took place. On the basis of lack of evidence against the women, all the arrested ladies were then acquitted.

He goes on multiple dates with women, only to get rejected everytime. His only friend is his pet turtle, Hardy, and also spends his leisure time working on his miniature planes. When he was a child, his father had killed his mother and then committed suicide himself. His aunt Persis has been his guardian since then.

At a relative's wedding, Freddy sees a girl named Kainaaz and awkwardly approaches her to talk to her, but is pushed away by her husband Rustom, who was handling the catering for the wedding. Kainaaz meets Freddy at his clinic the next day, saying she wants to extract her wisdom tooth, and he carries out the surgery the next day. Freddy soon falls in love with her and cannot stop thinking about her. He goes nearby her house, just to catch a glimpse of her, and sees her being beaten by Rustom. Freddy calls her the next day, insisting her to visit him, so that he can check if she is healing properly post the surgery. He questions her about the wounds on her face, and she reveals that Rustom is abusive towards her and would kill her if she ever leaves him. They start dating secretly and she reciprocates his feelings. They plan to get married and get rid of Rustom by killing him.

Freddy kills him by running him over with his car and goes straight to his farmhouse in Karjat and stays there for a week, also getting the damage inflicted upon his car repaired. The police cannot find any evidence related to Rustom's death. On returning, Freddy goes to meet Kainaaz at her home, but is shocked to see her with Raymond, a chef. Kainaaz reveals to Freddy that she never loved him and only used him to get her husband killed so that she and Raymond can be together and she can become the owner of the restaurant previously owned by her husband. Freddy is devastated and decides to seek revenge. He sneaks into Kainaaz's house and replaces her facewash with liquid dishwasher detergent, as Kainaaz had previously mentioned being allergic to sodium sulfate. He also removes the brake fluid from Raymond's car. Kainaaz wakes up to find her skin covered in rashes due to the allergy and Raymond drives her to the hospital, but due to the brakes being faulty, they suffer an accident and are injured.

They go to his house and beat him, but the police arrive there, as Freddy had informed them beforehand. They reveal to the police that Freddy had killed Rustom but cannot provide any proof as Freddy had sneaked into Kainaaz's house and secretly deleted all his photos and messages from their phones while they were asleep. They later again break into Freddy's house while he is away and kill Hardy, leaving him heartbroken. An eye witness to Rustom's murder reveals Freddy's car number to the police, though he had not seen the driver's face. When the police come to interrogate Freddy, he lies that in order to frame him, Raymond had taken his car to kill Rustom and proves it by showing false messages which he had himself secretly sent from Kainaaz's phone to his phone, and the CCTV footage of them breaking into his house.

Freddy calls Kainaaz and Raymond, and says that the police would be coming for them and that he would spare them, if they come and apologize to him at his farmhouse. He also asks them to bring a suitcase along with them. The police see the CCTV footage of them leaving the house with the suitcase and assume that they have absconded. At the farmhouse, they attempt to kill Freddy, but he overpowers and captures them. He then violently extracts both their teeth without anesthesia which results in their death. As Freddy buries Kainaaz, he confesses that he still loves her and that the joke is on him.

Havaldar Ishar Singh  is part of a Sikh Troop part of British Indian Army posted at Gulistan fort along the Indian Afgan border. His immediate superior British officer is jealous of him because of Ishar Singh's superior fighting skills. The British officer thinks low about the native Indians thinking them cowards. While just returning back from a border patrol, the troop sees a group of Afgan tribesmen are trying to kill a married woman. The woman was forcefully married and she is not acknowledging her marriage. She wanted to run away from her husband's household and got caught in that process. The tribesmen led by a Mullah is about to kill the lady in the Afgan Territory where as the Sikh troop was watching this just across the Indian border. Ishar Singh saves the lady by killing the lady's husband thereby disobeying his immediate superior British officer.Once the troop reaches the base fort, the British officer reports Ishar Singh's disobedience to his Commanding Officer who sits at near by Lackhort fort. The Commanding Officer was on his way to Gulistan fort. The Afgans attack Gulistan fort and Ishar Singh fought valiantly killing many Afghans. The joint attack by the troops available in Gulistan fort and the troops of the Commanding Officer  made the Afghans flee.
Ishar Singh got a punishment transfer to Saragarhi Fort. Saragarhi fort sits between Gulistan and Lackhort fort and enables communication between them. When Ishar Singh's transfer orders were issued his officer humiliated him telling the Indians are cowards and they are slaves to the British. Ishar Singh moves towards Saragarhi fort. The woman he had rescued earlier gives him some sweet as a sense of gratitude. Ishar Singh fondly remembers his wife on his way to Saragarhi.
When Ishar Singh reached at Sargarhi Fort to take charge he found the troop to be in mess and loose. He enforced discipline in the troop and strengthened them. The troop respected Ishar Singh. The troop has Gurmukh Singh  who knew English. Naik Lal Singh  was Ishar Singh's second in command. Khuda Dad is a Pathan who works as the fort cook and orderly. Meanwhile the Mullah who was trying to mob lynch the woman formed an alliance among the Afghan tribes and motivates them to attack on the Indian Territories as an unified force.Meanwhile Ishar Singh and Lal Singh went to a near by village in search of their informer. They came to know that all young-men from the village had enlisted for war. The village is left with kids, women and old men. The villagers are struggling to repair the village mosque. Ishar Singh motivated his men to help the villagers build the mosque. The Sikhs were initially reluctant. But then they realized that one Gurdwara was build by a Muslim Fakir. That information changed their heart. Ishar Singh and his men helped the villagers with it and won the heart of the villagers. One Sikh Sepoy  was touched by the fact that one Afghan village lady had gave him one almond and shown her love.
The British Commanding Officer from Lockhart fort saw the Afgan Forces marching towards Sargarhi Fort. He alerted the Sargarhi Fort by some cipher code. Ishar Singh and his men received the message and saw thousands of tribesmen encircling Sargarhi Fort. They have also alerted the Gulistan Fort. The tribesmen were around ten thousand. They cut all routes of re-enforcement to Sargarhi Fort. The Mullah killed the woman whom Ishar Singh had rescued earlier in-front of the Sargarhi Fort. The Commanding Officer sent a message to the Sikh Troops to abandon the fort and flee. The Sikhs laughed listening the order of fleeing. One of the lance Naik Chanda Singh  doubted the leadership capabilities of Ishar Singh. Ishar Singh put one saffron turban and motivated the force to fight the Afgans in the name of Pride, Religion and country, not just because they are employed as Sepoy in the British Indian Army.The Afgans were playing their drums. Ishar Singh started playing his own drum. The Afghans got demotivated and stopped playing their own. Ishar Singh than aimed at the mullah. One Afgan leader assured the Mullah that the gun is out of range and it would not reach the distance where the Afgans are standing. When Ishar Singh fired it hit one of the Afghan soldier and he died. The Sikhs got astonished as the the bullet was not supposed cover the distance. Ishar Singh explained that the air is moving from their side to the Afgans. So due to the air flow the gun was bale to hit the tribesman.
Ishar Singh deployed his force in position. Gurmukh Singh asked that actually the Commanding Officer has ordered them to fight. But why Ishar Singh told that the order was to flee. Ishar Singh told that the British considered the Indians as slaves. But the Sikhs knowing that the order was to flee, denied the order and choose to fight till death against a numerically far superior enemy by their own free will. By doing so the Sikhs had chosen their death by own free will and not because they are getting paid by British. Khuda Dad volunteered to fight. But Ishar Singh told him to provide water to all soldiers, both Sikhs and Afgans when they are thirsty and it would be the greatest service on the theater of war.The attack started by the Afgans. The Afgans has one ace marksman. He targeted one Sikh who died. Gurmukh Singh was an in-experienced soldier. He was unable to fight. So Ishar Singh asked him to keep on informing the CO about the battle condition. The information received that a British division would arrive by next day. So Ishar Singh decided to prolong the battle so that Afgans couldn't advance and Gulistan and Lockhart forts would survive. He tricked the Afgans by releasing two captured Afghan soldiers. The Afghan soldiers were denoted when they reached the Afghan camp. Ishar Singh also killed the marksman by attaching his monocular into his gun and thereby exactly targeting the marksman who was hiding in between two big rocks. Few Pathans started attacking the Fort door. The Sikhs shoot protected the door, but soon ran out of bullets. They attacked the Pathans with bayonets and Indian club. The Pathans ran away from the fort door. When the Sikhs were getting into the fort Pathans started shooting them. Lal Singh alone fought with them outside the fort and asked one of the Sepoy to close the fort door. Meanwhile the Pathans managed to destroy the back wall of the fort by using explosive. The Sikhs were only 4 remaining. Ishar Singh asked Gurmukh to send message to his old superior who had humiliated him with expletives. Gurmukh Singh messaged the same expletives to the British officer.Ishar Singh removed his stripes from his uniform. He put his sword into fire. He gain remembered his wife. When the Afghans entered the fort Ishar Singh attacked them ferociously slaying hundreds of Afghans alone. When Ishar Singh was about to kill one Afghan, he found him to be a kid and stopped for second to spare him. In the same time one Afghan shot him. Ashar Singh kept on fighting. Khuda Dad was providing drinking water to the dying Afghans. The mullah killed him. The same Afghan kid also attacked Ishar Singh. The Mullah wanted to keep his feet on Ishar Singh's turban. When he was trying to do so Ishar Singh killed him. The Afgan chieftain impressed by Ishar Singh's bravery told his men not to touch turban and asked what his name is. The Afghan chief told that he would always remember him. Chanda Singh also got killed in the process of killing many enemies. The Afghans realized that their plan to take all the three forts by evening has failed. They could not advance any more. They need to go back.One Afghan chief Gul Badshah  couldn't digest his defeat. He wanted Gurmukh Singh burnt inside the signaling post. Gurmukh Singh written the name of all martyred including his name in the fort wall with a coal. He shot few Afghans. The Afghans fired the post. Gurmukh Singh came out of his post with fire around his body. He shouted in the name of Gurus and caught some gunpowder and hold himself to Gul Badshah. Both of them died due to the explosion. The the shout reached near by both forts. The Sikh soldier present their also started shouting in the name of their Guru.

He goes on multiple dates with women, only to get rejected everytime. His only friend is his pet turtle, Hardy, and also spends his leisure time working on his miniature planes. When he was a child, his father had killed his mother and then committed suicide himself. His aunt Persis has been his guardian since then.

At a relative's wedding, Freddy sees a girl named Kainaaz and awkwardly approaches her to talk to her, but is pushed away by her husband Rustom, who was handling the catering for the wedding. Kainaaz meets Freddy at his clinic the next day, saying she wants to extract her wisdom tooth, and he carries out the surgery the next day. Freddy soon falls in love with her and cannot stop thinking about her. He goes nearby her house, just to catch a glimpse of her, and sees her being beaten by Rustom. Freddy calls her the next day, insisting her to visit him, so that he can check if she is healing properly post the surgery. He questions her about the wounds on her face, and she reveals that Rustom is abusive towards her and would kill her if she ever leaves him. They start dating secretly and she reciprocates his feelings. They plan to get married and get rid of Rustom by killing him.

Freddy kills him by running him over with his car and goes straight to his farmhouse in Karjat and stays there for a week, also getting the damage inflicted upon his car repaired.

8983228,Jhund,Biography Drama Sport team football people police slum life college game station airport,Biography Drama Sport NGO Based called life retired sports teacher founded team managed rehabilitate street kids keeping drugs crime turning soccer players,"Many residents of the slum are forced to turn to crime and extreme tactics to survive. Some people think in extremely backward ways, while others try to stay progressive in a really bad environment. Some slums are prosperous and thrive, while others are difficult to live in, and most people struggle to get through the day. Where can one find hope for better days or a better life with a survival rate such as theirs?

“Jhund” is a moving biographical account of Vijay Barse’s life told through the eyes of Vijay Borade, a senior football coach at St. John’s Academy who imparts lessons to the adults in his community and trains a team. When he comes across Ankush ‘Don’ Masram, who is fleeing Sabhya and his thugs, he breaks up the fight and instructs the man to mind his own business. Borade tries to confront him, but Ankush simply walks away. After seeing the way they live, Borade wants to help the community but doesn’t know how to go about it.

We discover that Borade’s son is en route to New York City to study management. He is unhappy with his father, but he understands his position. When it starts pouring, and Borade goes by the slum, he witnesses their sporting prowess. While Borade lives in a gated community and teaches football at a college, he still makes his way to the slum, hoping to glimpse a way to change their lives. When he asks his wife for a modest sum of money, he decides to return to the same Godi Gadam slum neighborhood in front of his college campus.
When Borade breaks the ice by drawing one child with the ball and offering him 500 rupees if he and the others continue to play with the ball for half an hour. They start to wonder how he always keeps his word and pays them at the end of the half-hour every time. Then he breaks off and disappears. Now that he has gone missing, they feel compelled to find him and ask why he left.

When they find him, they ask him to let them play on the condition that they pay him back later. However, he respectfully declines and closes the door. They realize that they love to play at 6 p.m. every day. They go back to his residence and inquire about the football. Everything is going according to Borade’s plan, and none of the teenagers is aware of it.Borade gradually wins them over and establishes a bond with them by teaching them the rules of football. He teaches kids about goal posts, teams, and team spirit, as well as not touching the ball with their hands. They gradually improve, but it is all for naught if they do not have a goal in mind to reach as a challenge to overcome.

He assures them that they can compete with his college football squad. The contest is held with the approval of the college, which was granted against their preferences. The other side of the fence, which has been meticulously shut to keep people from the ghetto out, is unlocked for the first time because these teenagers need their cheerleaders to encourage them. The beauty of sport is that it can bring people from all walks of life together for sport.

They win the game 3-2 on penalty shots after they tie the game and experience a full game that ends with a draw . It’s their first victory for their inner pride and their social standing. They demonstrate that they are capable of competing. It is also Borade’s first accomplishment. They win this game, but Ankush’s luck runs out, and the team’s morale begins to rise as Borade believes that a National Slum Football Tournament is something they should seriously pursue. After Borade retires from coaching at St. John’s College, the squad eventually hosts the tournament to choose who will participate in the International Slum Soccer Tournament.
Ankush ‘Don’ Masram is your typical drug dealer, phone, and gold chain snatcher from the slums. Bhavana, a girl from St. John’s College, is his crush. He still has a chance to accomplish his aspirations, but he can’t help but succumb to his survival instincts of becoming violent and defending himself by all means. When Sabhya continues to seek vengeance for the destruction of his store, which Ankush, Babu, Angel, and a few others are involved in, Ankush finds it impossible to break free from Sabhya’s stronghold over him and go forward in his life.
Ankush gets into a confrontation with Sabhya at the beginning of the movie because he has been staring at him for too long. When Sabya pursues Ankush and is slapped by him, Ankush runs into Borade, who challenges him to pick a battle with him in the hopes of convincing him that it was needless. When Borade starts to believe in Ankush’s ability to become the team’s best forward and scorer, he gets into trouble when Ankush goes and knives a couple of Sabhya’s men. Ankush disappears, only communicating with Angel. When Angel answers the phone one day, Borade chats with him and instructs him to report to the police station. Hesitantly, he agrees.

When Borade arrives and assists in his release, the police begin whacking him around. On the other hand, Ankush keeps his blade in his denim jeans’ side pocket. They prepare for the numerous matches as time passes, and Borade still has to overcome many obstacles in his path to helping these people. The most important thing is to get everyone’s passports in order so they can fly into another country and compete in the International Slum Football Tournament. Ankush faces a significant challenge in obtaining his passport. Police clearance is essential. With a criminal past like his, it would seem almost impossible.
After returning from New York City, Borade’s son becomes involved in his father’s cause and ensures that everything runs properly. At this point, his son asks his father why he had to mortgage the house when he was actively looking to obtain financing. Borade, on the other hand, had made his choice. He and his wife convince many families that their children must have passports to fly. While other families rush to prepare their children’s passports, Ankush must go to the police station to cleanse his name. The Inspector tells Borade that this is a court case that can only be settled in court.

This is painful for him, yet he goes to court and protects these children. He makes his case to the judge, and the judge’s decision on the case is still pending. Ankush’s spirits are at an all-time low, and he is prepared to go to the police station and murder the chief. With fury in his eyes, Babu and Angel saw him heading towards the station. They make it a point to speak with him and persuade him not to do something like this. They tell him he is no longer that person. In that compound, they drink their sorrows away.

The next day, everyone is preparing to travel to the airport and board the aircraft. Everyone has packed their belongings and is ready to travel. They are passing through security. Only Ankush has not yet made it to the airport. A delivery man arrives that morning, and Ankush receives a call informing him that his passport has arrived and only he can collect it from the delivery man. He joyfully returns home and packs his belongings. Sabhya tries to stall and smack him along the way, demanding his respect. Bhavana catches up with Ankush just in time with a cop to break up the fight, and Ankush is whisked away to the airport in time for his flight.

The last thing he must do at the airport is go through security. They force him to remove everything, yet the beeper continues to ring. Finally, the security guard discovers the blade in his denim jeans’ knee pocket. He removes it and throws it away, which causes him to cry profusely. He feels a sense of unburdening as he throws it away. He’s leaving behind a certain existence, but this time it’s for real. He is now a professional player on his way to conquering the globe. He goes through the security checkpoint, and the entire team is ready to put their skills to the test in a new country.

1447508,Peepli [Live],Comedy Drama family suicide money death Chief interview save CPI bro rural local opposition reporter plans elections,Comedy Drama media impoverished farmer threat end life invites attention politicians,"Natha is a poor farmer from the village of Peepli in Mukhya Pradesh, who struggles to farm enough money for his family made up of his elder brother, Budhia, his wife, Dhaniya, his three young children and his ailing mother Amma, who spends most of her time lying down and screaming at Natha and Dhaniya. Natha and Budhia often pretend to go out farming when actually they save up whatever money they have to buy alcohol. This has left the whole family famished and now the banks are demanding repayment of loans or else the family will be stripped of their land and house. In the meantime, the Mukhya Pradesh Government have called a by-election due to continuous criticism of their blind eye towards the desperate poverty that surrounds India's largest state. The opposition Apna Dal Party believe they have a chance to form the government in this election as the people have lost faith in the long-serving Sammaan Party and its Chief Minister, Ram Babu Yadav who, along with Federal Agriculture Minister, Saleem Kidwai, believes in the industrialisation of rural areas.

To save his land and to save his family from becoming homeless, Natha, encouraged by his brother, decides to commit suicide after he requests help from the rural headmen and they suggest that his committing suicide is a good way to get loan money waived, and after which his family will receive heavy compensation for his death. While Natha and his brother are discussing this possibility at a local tea stall, the news gets reported by Rakesh, a local reporter from Peepli. This report then gets picked up and highlighted by the national English news channels and reaches the Chief Minister. The media starts surrounding Peepli sensing the possibility of a sensational suicide story. One ITVN journalist particularly keen on filming the event of Natha's death is Daytime Presenter, Nandita Malik. She joins the local reporter Rakesh Kapoor and takes desperate measures to interview Natha and his family on the subject of Natha's suicide. However things get more tricky when rival Hindi news channel, ""Bharat Live"" finds out about Natha and Peepli. The news channel clashes with ITVN and each try to film Natha's impending death in their own manner. The Sammaan Party also soon discover Natha's plans and try to buy off Natha with sops to prevent him from committing suicide. Opposition parties like the Apna Dal and the CPI also get involved and plan to use Natha as a path to power in the elections. Peepli soon becomes the centre of attention across Mukhya Pradesh.

Nandita's frantic attempts to interview Natha get worse when Rakesh does not find Natha or anyone else in Peepli to interview. She seems unimpressed with Rakesh's compassionate stand towards Natha and believes that as reporters their duty lies in reporting and following the news and nothing else. On the other hand, ""Bharat Live"" continues to be successful in their attempts to interview. Yet as time goes on, Natha does not die. Meanwhile, the Sammaan Party realise that if Natha commits suicide, they will lose the elections. The rural headmen secretly kidnap Natha and hold him ransom for money from the opposition. Yet their plans are foiled when Rakesh discovers Deepak and his men holding Natha hostage at a Peepli barn. A rush occurs when people from Apna Dal, the CPI, ITVN, Bharat Live and Peepli villagers all rush to find Natha. In the confusion, a spillage accident from a Petromax lamp sets fire to the barn, which explodes and Rakesh is killed. The Government officials mistake Rakesh for Natha and refuse to pay Natha's family the compensation money due to the death being an accident. Meanwhile, Natha is in fact alive and flees to Gurgaon and is seen working as a day labourer in the construction industry.

6580564,102 Not Out,Comedy Drama life son task home childhood visiting deceased due calls reminds completes,Comedy Drama comedy est man drama film actor playing wanting alive record legendary break legend son plays grumpy,"Babulal Vakharia  is a 75-year-old unenthusiastic widower who believes that he is too aged and fragile to enjoy life. His 102-year-old father Dattatraya Vakharia  is his stark opposite who enjoys life in his jovial ways as his mental age is just 26. Dhirubhai Srivastava , also known as Dhiru, is an employee working at the nearby medical store who delivers medicines to the Vakharias. Dhiru likes Dattatraya due to his lively attitude but is scared of Babulal due to his grumpy nature. Meanwhile, Dattatraya aims to break the record of a longest-living Chinese person on Earth, who lived up till 118 years of age. He seeks to get rid of all the negative and boring elements surrounding him to accomplish his goal. Hence, he threatens to send his son to an old age home as that will be more convenient for Babulal too. After Babulal protests, Dattatraya allows him to stay at home only if he completes some tasks.

Firstly, Babulal writes a love letter to his deceased wife Chandrika, in which, he expresses dismay as she had once got into an argument with his deceased mother Saraswati but never with his father. Secondly, he stops visiting his doctor's clinic for a daily checkup, instead of accusing the doctor of theft as per Dattatraya's advice. According to the third task, Dattatraya asks Babulal to cut holes in his childhood blanket which he and Saraswati had bought for him in Kashmir; Babulal instantly rejects his proposal.

Later, Dhiru takes Babulal to a playground which reminds him of his childhood memories. He is subsequently taken to a church, which reminds Babulal of the memories he had spent with his estranged son Amol Vakharia , who lives in the US. He becomes sorrowed and buys a cake from a city bakery, distributing it to young children on the streets. Babulal even completes the third task by cutting holes in the blanket and begins to appreciate his father's outlook on life, much to Dattatraya's delight.

Few months later, things start to take a turn when Amol tries to call up Babulal repeatedly but Dattatraya cleverly disconnects his phone calls, not wanting Amol to communicate with his son. However, Babulal learns about Dattatraya's interruption and calls Amol who informs him that he will be soon visiting India. Dattatraya gives Babulal his last task which is to kick Amol out of their house once he will arrive in India, for all his negligence towards his family. He is aware that Amol's motive of visiting them after several years is to claim their property as their heir. Not wanting to behave rudely with his son, Babulal gets furious at Dattatraya and stops talking to him.

While trying to convince Babulal, Dattatraya reveals to Dhiru that Babulal had spent all his savings to send Amol abroad for his studies. However, Amol ignored him by telling him nothing about his new life over there, getting married, and settling in the US. He even discloses that after Amol's settlement in America, Chandrika suffered from Alzheimer's disease in her last days and unfortunately, the only thing she remembered till her death was Amol. Babulal still chides Dattatraya for his advices against Amol and begs him not to interfere between them both. Dhiru also supports Babulal for the first time, thinking that Amol should be given a second chance.

However, Dattatraya reveals to Babulal and Dhiru that few months ago, he underwent a medical checkup and learnt that he has brain tumor and realised that he would not remain for long. This provoked him to cook up the story of his goal and the old age home for Babulal, in order to make Babulal get rid of his grumpy and unenthusiastic approach towards life. Babulal understands Dattatraya's pain and decides to fulfill his last wish for his happiness.

Eventually, Amol arrives in India and meets Babulal at the airport gate. Over there, Babulal confronts Amol over his pursuit of something apart from his teachings. He even berates him over how his negligence towards the family caused his mother's death. Handing over Amol's childhood savings, Babulal humiliates Amol in public and orders him to leave, delighting Dattatraya and Dhiru. Dattatraya then expresses his last wish before Babulal, that he should whistle loudly the moment he breathes his last. Babulal then takes Dattatraya for an outing from his wheelchair and the two happily dance in the rain.

One month later, Babulal and Dhiru are shown sitting by the sea in the happy memories of the recently deceased Dattatraya. Over there, Dhiru presents Babulal a recording of Dattatraya who predicts in it that the record of the longest living person will be broken by Babulal himself.","['Comedy', 'Drama']","102 Not Out is a 2018 comedy-drama film, with legendary actor Amitabh Bachchan playing a 102-year-old wanting to break the oldest-man-alive record.

15073166,IB 71,Action Thriller plan war Vidyut agent agents flight airspace time team make elaborate act informer favor,Action Thriller establishment front intelligence war agencies,"IB 71, a spy thriller ahead of 1971 Indo-Pakistan war, is an untold story based on true events where IB agent Dev Jammwal  is on a top secret mission to save the nation. In the year 1971, Pakistan was preparing for yet another war against India after 1948 and 1965, this time from the Eastern front in alliance with China. Intelligence Bureau  of India receives this crucial information about an impending attack from the eastern front. With limited time and resources, Avasti  the Director of IB, and Dev, an IB agent, device a daring plan in just 10 days along with 30 agents against 2 nations on the enemy soil without firing a single bullet.

The movie begins with a history of East Pakistan, which was on the brink of a civil war, and IB agents are also trying to get as much information as they can to understand the situation.As informed by the IB Chief about their man stuck in the camps of East Pakistan, an Indian Intelligence Bureau agent, under the garb of being a Pakistan Army officer, is sent to rescue the man. The information gathered from then East Pakistan proves that even though Pakistan is on the brink of a civil war in the eastern side of their country, they are also planning an elaborate attack on India using China. The only way to stop Pakistan is to bar them from using Indian airspace, but to be able to do that, India would require a concrete reason, such as an actual act of war or aggression, to make it official.Agent Dev was adamant about banning them from the airspace, but his senior officials were strictly against it because that would mean the neighboring countries would be alerted by the fact that India was aware of their plans. 

One of Dev’s colleagues, Joshi, lets him know that Qasim, a member of an extremist outfit that is fighting for Independent Kashmir, has been arrested on charges of plotting to hijack a flight and has now become a police informer. Dev comes up with a foolproof plan and presents it to his senior, N.S. Awasthi. The man is not sure if it will be successful, but seeing Dev’s confidence allows him to give the go-ahead to this elaborate plan of action. The game plan would include luring Qasim and his accomplice Ashfaq into hijacking a dummy aircraft that would be filled with IB agents, and flying the plane to Pakistan. Qasim will demand the release of his comrades who spoke in favor of a free Kashmir. Once the flight is in Pakistani airspace, the Indian government can only wait for their neighbors to acknowledge the hijackers, and they will declare it an act of war, allowing them to close the airspace.Pakistan has an informer that is keeping an eye on Qasim and Ashfaq so that they do not take any untoward action as per the orders sent from the top. The enemy nation is not keen on letting India know about their elaborate plan, which is why there is radio silence.With Qasim and Ashfaq falling for the plan, there is nobody that can stop them from carrying out this ghastly act. The two of them are victims of rampant brainwashing, and banking on their agenda, Agent Dev, as the pilot, takes off from Jammu. At the right moment, the young men make sure to do the deed, and the flight is taken to Lahore due to low fuel. It is not clear if the fuel reduction ploy was the plan of the entire team or was just an impromptu emergency they faced. Despite having no permission, the flight landed in Lahore and thus putting the plan in motion, and they can only hope things will go in their favor. Agent Dev, as a pilot, also encourages Ashfaq and Qasim to burn down the plane if things do not go in their favor. Just another way to make sure they push the men to go to the extreme and worsen the situation between the two nations on the cusp of war.Unfortunately, Joshi is caught by the Pakistani informer in Srinagar, not far from the airport, and is killed by him. The same informant finally learns of an elaborate plan to deceive Pakistan. This seems like stalemate storytelling because Joshi was introduced just so he could be killed off to tug at our heartstrings. Qasim and Ashfaq got trapped hook, line, and sinker. It is the case of many young people who get carried away by extremist ideologues and are blind to the hypocrisy of the faction they join. Ashfaq recognizes Dev as the person who claimed to be fighting for their cause. Once their demands are being considered by the Pakistani government, led by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and the Indian High Commission, all the passengers, including the pilots, are moved to a local hotel for the night, and it is decided that they will be sent back to India in the coming days by road.Afsal Aaga was under pressure from the army and the government to make sure no diplomatic incidents took place, wanting to find every detail that would help him bring down whatever the intelligence agency from across the border was planning. To seal his doubts, the informer from Kashmir reaches Lahore to let them know that the pilot is an IB agent. As the team in Lahore is about to arrest Dev, the entire entourage at the hotel is attacked by all the agents, and all of them overpower the existing security inside the hotel.Afsal Aga and his team are tied up in a room. Meanwhile, the Indian agents posing as passengers are waiting for the new security team to escort them to the border. There seems to be confusion in the Pakistani entourage as they are tricked into believing that it was their Prime Minister’s order to release the passengers as a gesture of goodwill. The team safely reaches the border and is sent across to their home country, and this mission is close to being a success, even though Afsal Aga and his superior army officer were the first to crack the news that India was planning to close Indian airspace. None of them could stop the plan from being a triumph. On checking the belongings on the flight, all of them turned out to be fake, and they aggressively questioned Qasim and Ashfaq about their knowledge of the entire hijacking being a major trap. The two of them are angry, which makes them set the plane on fire, as Dev had suggested. Dev only took advantage of the already charged-up men, and it worked in their favor because setting the Indian plane on fire on Pakistani soil is seen as a way to get rid of the evidence and may be called an act of war. This was enough for the Indian government to put an embargo on the airspace against the Pakistani air force, putting all of their plans on hold

Baali had counseled him that selection is also about money and politics and Arjun needed to be patient, but Arjun refused to give another yr to this quest.Reality hits when Arjun does not have rs 500 to buy the Indian team jersey for Ketan. Arjun is currently suspended from his job  and Vidya is the only earning member of the family . Vidya had given rs 100 to Arjun to pay the electricity bill, but he gambled it away with his friends, in the hope of winning rs 500.

Arjun comes back home. Ketan makes Arjun realize that now Arjun is his hero . Arjun decides that he cannot live like this and tells Vidya that he is going back to play in the finals. Vidya relents and gets him a plane ticket1996/97 and the Ranji final is between Punjab and Karnataka. Karnataka score 454/6 and declare. Karnataka has a fearsome fast bowler Gowda who bounces Punjab out. Punjab is soon 45/4. Arjun goes for a duck and Punjab is all out for a measly score. Karnataka scores 157 in their second innings. Punjab needs to score 352 runs in 47 overs to win, else Karnataka will be declared champions.

Arjun gets on strike on the 3rd ball of the final over. 13 from 3 required. 4, 6, 3, as Punjab win by 1 wicket.Later he is submitted into the Indian cricket team.

9420648,Bala,Comedy baldness marriage balding fair skin accepts complexioned dark wig wedding life beauty,Comedy situation story man balding prematurely copes,"The film opens in Kanpur where 10-year-old students caricature and tease a balding teacher. Balmukund ""Bala"" Shukla , a popular and well-coiffed kid, leads the teasing. Bala borrows notes from the studious and dark-complexioned Latika  and passes them off  to the fair-complexioned Shruti to impress her. When Latika calls him out, Bala berates her for being dark-complexioned. The narrator describes how society, particularly in the matrimonial process, values beauty and fair-skin over other accomplishments.Years later, Bala is a balding late-twenties fairness cream salesman and late-night nightclub comic, who is struggling with his baldness. One day, in a rage, Bala lashes out at his middle-aged, bald, once a Ranji cricket player father Hari Shukla : the father's balding genes have killed the son's prospects. Bachchan Dubey  is Bala's guru and gives him novel tips on how to avoid baldness, but none work.
Some days later his father presents him with a wig and consoles him and explains that baldness is an external feature and need not have anything to do with ones accomplishments and prospects. Bala dons the wig and resumes his work  with new vigor. In due course Bala meets a pretty  model, Pari , and courts her with his mimicry and his songs. They decide to marry. Some days before the wedding, Bala is stricken by conscience and sends her a text disclosing his baldness. Unbeknownst to him the text accidentally goes to someone else and Pari does not see it. Bala assumes she has accepted his baldness and they marry.Latika has her share of troubles. Many boys and families come to see her but reject her because of her dark skin. Among these prospective suitors is Rohan , an Australia-settled NRI who is attracted to Latika but the meeting blows up when his mother mentions Latika's complexion and Latika storms out. Rohan asks to meet Latika and they reconcile until he mentions he was initially attracted to her due to her Instagram profile. Latika reveals that she is not on Instagram, and it is revealed that Bala had created a fake profile with airbrushed pictures of Latika at her aunt's behest. Latika is left fuming at the whole ordeal.Latika storms into Bala's home on the day after his wedding and shouts at him. Bala may be ashamed about his baldness but Latika has no such feeling about her complexion. She warns him not to interfere in her life anymore. Pari hears this outburst and thus discovers Bala's baldness and walks out on him. Bala is dejected. Some days later Bala receives a court notice: Pari has charged him with fraud and wants the marriage annulled. Bala visits her to talk it over. Pari reveals her feelings. She was blessed with good looks and not much else. She knew she was a below-average student and thus could not enter any other real profession. Her looks are all she has: they are the source of the attention she received all her life and they are the source of her livelihood as a model. She accepts that her only criterion for selecting a husband was his good looks; she also accepts that other girls may have other useless criteria  but this is all she has.Latika apologizes to Bala as her outburst broke his marriage. But it would have broken anyway. Bala engages her as his lawyer. The case begins. Latika cross-examines Pari who plainly accepts she married Bala because of his wits and charm. Pari also accepts Bala did not mislead or defraud her but she points out that Bala was not particularly forthcoming about his baldness. If he is not comfortable with his own self then he can hardly sustain anyone else. Pari's lawyer moves that Pari has her own right to want to annul the marriage whether there was fraud or not. As the arguments are heard Bala interrupts the proceedings and moves that Pari does have her right to want to annul the marriage. The judge orders so. Outside court Latika angrily confronts Bala: she could have turned the case. Bala shrugs; the law cannot compel anyone to love anyone and a half-attempt at marriage will not work anyway. Some time later during one of his fair-cream sales events he realizes beauty is merely skin-deep and he publicly sheds his wig. At a school reunion he apologizes to the balding teacher.Bala realizes Latika is probably the perfect partner for him. He runs to propose to her but when he walks in he sees Rohan and his family have come to finalize the wedding. He proposes anyway but Latika turns him down gently; she actually likes Rohan. Bala is disappointed, but is able to resume his friendship with Latika.

6173990,Gold,Drama History Sport team time work players hockey gold play medal Finally win captain semi-finals,Drama History Sport making win gold nation journey man instrumental medal free,"The story begins around the time of the Berlin Olympics in 1936, when the Indian team played the hockey finals against Germany. Despite the Germans attempting to play rough against the Indian team, the Indians start winning in the second half, when the team's assistant manager, Tapan Das , shows them the Indian Flag during the half time break. When the captain Samrat  and team receive the gold medal, the British National Anthem is played and the flag of British India is hoisted, but the Indian team promise themselves that they will win a Gold medal once again on behalf of their motherland, after India gets Independence.

The subsequent Olympics are cancelled because of World War II. After the war, a drunk and spoiled Tapan roams and loses in several bets but sobers up when he gets the news that the next Olympics will be held in London in 1948. He holds aspirations of making India play hockey as a free country, coaching a novice hockey team to earn independent India's first Olympic gold medal at the 1948 Summer Olympics.

Tapan now struggles to win his position as a joint manager of the team and promises to bring up best players from the new generation. He manages to convince Mr. Wadia, and goes out for his work back. He meets the former hockey captain Samrat, now retired, to lead to guide the team. But Samrat refuses and suggests teammate Imtiaz Ali Shah . Imtiaz, a great contributor of the 1936 Olympics along with Samrat, was a soldier for the Indian National Army. Tapan meets Imtiaz and they decide to continue their dream and oath to win the gold medal for an independent India. With Independence for India looming on the horizon, Tapan travels to different parts of India to scout for the best players for the team.

Finally Tapan keeps his promise and creates the national hockey team, taking players from several regions. Among them are Thakur Raghubir Pratap Singh  and Himmat Singh , a pair of talented centre forwards from Central India and Punjab.

Meanwhile, India gets Independence, but is also partitioned into India and Pakistan. During a riot, Imtiaz gets injured when some Hindus and Sikhs tried to burn him alive, but is saved by Tapan and Himmat. They reach Imtiaz's house come hockey club, but to their disappointment, his house is burnt and destroyed. A heartbroken Imtiaz refuses to stay further in India and leaves for Lahore. A heartbroken Tapan narrates that along with the division of the country, their dreams and aspirations also broke apart. Half the team ends up playing for Pakistan, while a few others - mainly Anglo-Indians - move to Australia.

Tapan decides to make it on his own, and brings up the team for practice at a small Buddhist School. The head monk of the ashram is convinced because he was a great fan of hockey and Samrat. The team is brought here through Tapan's own money. His wife, Monobina Das , also supports and helps him realize his dreams. The training begins but there is a lack of teamwork between the players due to several conflicts. Raghubir, who keeps on his pride, always tries himself to get over the hard working Himmat. On the other hand, Devang Chaturvedi is an efficient player with wit and wisdom. Tapan and Samrat finally teach the players a lesson of unity and conclude the training. Samrat makes Devang, the captain, Raghubir, the vice Captain and tells Tapan that Himmat is a hidden treasure to be used at the right time of the Olympics.

Mr. Wadia, as a chairperson of the Hockey Council, becomes the Head Coach and Tapan is once again honoured as the assistant manager of the team. A jealous Mehta  deceives Tapan by mixing some alcohol in his drink and an intoxicated Tapan behaves very badly in the party organized by the Hockey Council and is fired from his position, being replaced by Mehta.

The team is now brought to the Olympic level in London by Mehta, But Mehta's usual ego and pride brings upon his bad image to the players when they complain against him. Mr. Wadia then sends for Tapan, and Tapan comes to London with the blessing of Mr. Wadia, who himself returned there from New York. The Olympics begin but Himmat is not allowed to play.

India plays well to reach and win the semi-finals. But since he is not in the player list, Himmat thinks it is a conspiracy by Raghubir just to let him down. During a celebration, Himmat starts fighting with Raghubir and a conflict grows between them, which tarnishes Himmat's image. Devang and Raghubir try to explain to Himmat that it was Tapan who selected the player list for the game, but all in vain.

Finally, in the semi-finals, Tapan has listed Himmat to play, but since other players had complained against his behaviour the previous night, Himmat is not allowed to play. Tapan explains the reason that in the league matches, the opponent players mark the good players, and in the semi-finals or finals, they have marked making it difficult for them to play well. Although India wins the semi-finals, it turns a hard match.

In the finals, during the first half against Great Britain, Himmat is benched again,and Great Britain scores 2 goals. During half time in the Indian dressing room Tapan has a heated argument with Mehta about the need of Himmat's playing when Mehta refuses to change the team at the last minute. Tapan shows everyone the Indian Flag and tells them he has been carrying it since Berlin Olympics to see his dream come true. He leaves the room telling Raghubir that if he doesen't understand the unity of team now it will be too late for him.

Then after, the second half starts Himmat is seen playing and then scores a goal with the help of Raghubir. Although bad weather conditions seemed in favor of the British, Tapan asks everyone to open their shoe to maintain grip on the ground. Finally India wins the match at 4–3 with Himmat scoring the last minute goal.

Finally, when the captain, Devang receives the gold medal, the National Flag of independent India is hoisted and the anthem ""Jana Gana Mana"" is played. A proud Tapan concludes the narration with the words ""Vande Mataram""  as the anthem ends and tears of happiness take place.","['Drama', 'History', 'Sport']",The journey of a man who was instrumental in making India win its first Olympic gold medal as a free nation.,"M.S.

Murad asks Aarti to fight the case on his behalf.Next Santosh demonstrates that Shahid used a pvt telephone network & Aarti counters by saying that Bilal was not educated & hence had no clue what the antenna and the equipment was being used for. He also shows that Bilal's mobile SIM shop issued 14 SIMS without proper KYC, 4 of which were used in the blast by Shahid and his associates. He also presents evidence that 1 day after the blast, Bilal received USD 1500 in cash from a Pakistani courier. Aarti tries to argue that Bilal's sister sent the money, but her arguments are ineffective.After the sudden death of Bilal, Aftab  comes home & begs Murad and entire family to leave India. But Murad decides to stay and fight on. Aarti takes the matter into her hands to get her father-in-law and his family acquitted of all the charges that were laid upon them on the basis of mere prejudice that all Muslims are breeders of terrorists and all the terrorists are Muslims.
She shows that the phone calls from Pakistan were from Bilal's family. The telephone antenna was installed by Shahid, saying that it was to boost the TV dish signal and the whole family believed him. she calls Murad and asks him prove his patriotism, proving that it is improvable and the whole case is built on perceptions. Then she calls investigating officer Danish, and asks him if un-touchability and caste-ism are also terrorism by his definition? She puts Danish under emotional pressure and gets him to admit that he could have arrested Shahid, but due to his prejudice and bias, he shot him instead.",['Drama'],One family member tries to help her own family when they are trapped in a dark controversy.,"Shahid,Bajrangi Bhaijaan,Baby,No One Killed Jessica,Sooryavanshi,Afwaah"

Before that, one of them mocks her and adds that she is a con with a female voice.Rashmi has always run at a blazing rate; her father was always encouraging of her tomboyish tendencies and her racing. Her father was killed in the Bhuj earthquake when she was competing in her school competition. Her fleet and agility continue to grow, but following the pain of losing her father during a race, she decides to stop competing in sprinting competitions.

She rescues an army guy from a landmine while working as a tour guide for a group of army men in her hometown. Gagan Thakur , an army soldier, discovers her extraordinary speed and persuades her and her mother Bhanuben , a strong-willed community lady, to participate in competitive sports. Her mother and two brothers are supportive and helpful.Rashmi astounds the selectors by winning every major race in the country. Despite the fact that she is not in training, she gets chosen for the national squad based on her natural skill. Niharika Chopra, the selector's daughter, teases her about being masculine. Niharka continues to torment her like a regular school bully and plots to bring her down.

After Rashmi wins three medals at the Asian Games, the national selector, Niharikas's father, is so upset that he asks Rashmi to have a sexual test, and a lady from the national sports system unfairly grounds her with a summons to be medically examined. Rashmi is forced to blood testing and sonography after being degraded by being asked to remove all of her clothes.

She fails the hyperandrogenism test because her testosterone levels are slightly higher than the usual woman's. Niharika and her pals mock her for being more of a guy than a woman when she returns to her hostel. Rashmi becomes enraged and gets engaged in a scuffle after being shocked and harmed, and Niharika is slightly injured.

Someone later complains about a boy being at a ladies' hostel, and Rashmi is detained; the cops smack her, and she is sent in the male jail. What will be happening now that Rashmi has failed the test?




Gagan Thakur, an army officer, saves Rashmi. The media hears about the gender test before the results are released, and there is a massive uproar in the media.

Rashmi has been banned from participating in sports due to elevated testosterone levels. Rashmi is mocked in the media for not being a woman, and she is exposed to a great deal of harassment. Rashmi's family and the people of her community are split.
When the lawyer Ishit Mehta  pays them a visit, Rashmi's mother tries to convince her to file a complaint against the sports authority, but Rashmi refuses, and her mother asks her to go since her house does not have a place for cowards. Rashmi then leaves her house and goes to live with Gagan.
Gagan supports her and recommends they marry. They marry in a tiny ceremony attended by his friends and family.Gagan urges Rashmi to keep practising in the hopes that the ban would be removed one day. Rashmi is convinced to launch a complaint against the sports authority for unfair testing and ban, as well as the police for human rights violations, after watching a television interview in which Niharika rants against her.

Meanwhile, they discover Rashmi is three months pregnant. Ishit is eager to utilise this knowledge to aid the argument for lifting the ban, but Rashmi refuses to let him.

Throughout the course of the investigation, it is revealed that Priyanka, Niharika's friend, contacted the police station on Mr. Chopra's orders to report about 'a male' staying in the ladies' hostel. Mr. Chopra is asked to retire from his position at the Sports Authority, and his daughter Niharika opposes him and isolates herself from him.

Ishit wins the case for Rashmi, and her ban is revoked. Her family and village are overjoyed.

13143988,Nail Polish,Drama identity movie paperweight Ranjeet case jail trauma act judge evidence killed victims numerous witnesses unclear,Drama Kapur Rajit Nail stars written directed mind legal thriller explores uncertainty human,"There are numerous witnesses and evidence, yet it is still unclear whether Veer Singh killed the victims. That is essentially what the film conveys. However, Veer sustains significant trauma after wounding the jail’s goon chief and being beaten by them.

As a result, his mind suddenly switches to the identity of a lady named Charu Raina. In any case, Veer wants everyone, including the audience, to think that. Veer’s refusal to cease the act even in front of Jaisingh is the turning point in the story, which has previously led everyone to believe that he is only acting out to prove to everyone that he is mentally ill.Veer  is unable to understand Jaisingh’s attempts to persuade him that dropping the act will assist the situation. The spectator is persuaded at this moment that the identity splitting is unquestionably not an act, as well as when the convicts begin to sexually assault Charu .

Shivkumar Subramaniam, the movie’s psychiatrist, explains to the judge and the attorneys that trauma might result in identity issues. The  accusation and the beating in jail were Veer’s two main sources of trauma. We learn more about his past and how his mind came to assume the identity of the 32-year-old Kashmiri lady while he is hypnotized in his Charu persona.

Jaisingh requests a mistrial in response to this information, which would mean that the case would be dismissed because Veer Singh, his client, is no longer alive. One more time, prosecutor Amit Kumar tries to persuade the court that everything is a ruse. However, the judge decides in Jaisingh’s favor, putting the case into a coma. Justice is not served to the parents of the murdered children.

However, the judge also declares that Veer Singh will always remain in the government’s psychiatric facility and that the case will resume from the beginning if he ever briefly remembers who he is. If you pay close attention, Manav Kaul tends to fidget with a paperweight while waiting for his hearing in the movie. And he always sits fearfully when he takes on the identity of Charu.

As soon as the verdict is read, Charu picks up the paperweight once more. Where did she get that solace from? We are all sent into a frenzy by Veer/Charu’s final glance at the camera while holding the paperweight. This final glance and the paperweight do indicate that Charu’s meek demeanor was all Veer’s doing to save him a life sentence for his crimes.The extent to which he was a psychopath can be used to explain how he endured all the traumas in prison while posing as Charu and never lost control. If he did kill, torture, and abuse the children, he was a psychopath who could even endure his suffering to survive and avoid being put in jail.

It might also imply that Charu simply chose the paperweight out of curiosity and that the claimed identity was accurate. Alternately, this could mean that Veer’s dissociative identity disorder is real, and this was the emergence of a third personality. This finale, which makes us think of the movie Shutter Island, raises a lot of questions. The most plausible explanation, however, is that Veer was alone responsible. After being beaten up in jail, Singh, in an extraordinary turn of events, assumes the character of Charu Raina, complete with cosmetics and “nail polish.” It’s simple to overlook the specifics of the movie’s climax because there are so many elements shown to the audience.

Under hypnosis, Singh takes on Charu’s personality and starts to reveal information about her background. She is originally from Kashmir, where she spent ten years in an unhappy marriage before the movie’s events. There, she met Singh, posing as Ranjeet, to catch a businessman while he was an undercover agent.They ultimately started dating. According to Charu, she helped Ranjeet entice the businessman by getting migrant kids to pose as students at an underprivileged school to trick him. When she confronted Ranjeet, he revealed his entire strategy and his purpose before killing her to conceal his identity.",['Drama'],"Nail Polish, written and directed by Bugs Bhargava Krishna, stars Arjun Rampal, Manav Kaul, Anand Tiwari and Rajit Kapur.

1785333,Chittagong,Action Drama War police Empire revolutionaries son story revolutionary friends Sukhen DIG join plan great led death,Action Drama War occupied School organize armed revolt kids sides casualties leads peasants regain successfully food-grains earlier commandeered,"The story is set against the backdrop of a little-known saga in 1930s British colonial India's East Bengal  where a group of schoolboys and young women, led by a schoolteacher Masterda Surya Sen , dared to take on the Empire. Chittagong is the story of a diffident 14-year-old boy, Jhunku . Swept up into this seemingly impossible mission, the reluctant teenager battles with self-doubts to achieve an improbable triumph.

Jhunku, now a 23-year-old youth, is being chased by the Bengal police. He hides himself in a bunker with his childhood friend Aparna . While hiding, he begins to reflect on his past hopes and dreams. The story goes to a flashback to narrate the events that happened 10 years ago.

In 1930, Surya Sen and his followers are protesting the death of the revolutionary Jatin Das. Jhunku is not allowed to join them by his lawyer father who wants him to study in England. Apart from fearing his father, Jhunku is also torn between his admiration and respect for the magistrate, Wilkinson  and his wife, who show great likings for him and his fascination for the charismatic figure of Masterda, who is followed and revered by most of his friends. Jhunku, due to his faith in Wilkinson who is personally against torturing revolutionaries, has great belief in British justice and believes that by getting an English education he might better equip himself to free his country. This causes arguments between him and his friends, especially Aparna. Wilkinson is opposed by the police inspector Major Johnson who defies his orders and arrests the protesters, and badly tortures Masterda.

In protest, some students hit the strict police officer Maj. Johnson  by spilling oil under his motorbike, making him fall. Enraged, Johnson makes random enquiries about the culprits but is unsuccessful. However, Wilkinson manages to confirm the truth out of Jhunku, and an enraged Johnson then shoots Sukhen , one of the boys involved. This incident makes Jhunku an outcast amongst his friends, and he becomes determined to avenge the death of Sukhen. Soon afterwards, Johnson is made the DIG of police although Wilkinson had requested his transfer. This incident further shocks Jhunku. All his faith on his tutor Sir Wilkinson is lost, and he joins Masterda's army. Meanwhile, Pritilata Waddedar  a school teacher by profession, is fascinated by the ideologies of Masterda and has great admiration for him. She wishes to join him in his future plans against the British Rule. She also appears to be in love with Nirmal sen  but he is reluctant to express his feelings.

Masterda and his comrades Nirmal Sen, Loknath Bal , Ambika Chakraborthy  and Ananta Singh  train the 50-odd students and plan to capture the city of Chittagong on 18 April 1930 by disconnecting all modes of communication. As per plan, the armoury of the police is captured by a group of revolutionaries led by Ganesh Ghosh and revolutionaries, led by Lokenath Baul takes over the Auxiliary Force armoury. Unfortunately the machine guns are not located. The revolutionaries also dislocate telephone and telegraph communications and disrupt the movement of the trains. After the successful raids, all the revolutionary groups gathered outside the police armoury where Surya Sen takes a military salute, hoisting the national flag and proclaims a provisional revolutionary government. The whole town is overjoyed at the success of Indian Republican Army and Chittagong is officially conquered by Surya Sen and his boys for one day. However, reinforcements from Calcutta soon set out to capture the rebels. Knowing of the army attack, the revolutionaries leave town before dawn and march towards the Jalalabad hill ranges, looking for a safe place. But the British Army's first wave is demolished by Masterda's teenagers. This enrages the British and they bring in machine guns. Harish also known as Tegra, the younger brother of Lokenath and a friend of Jhunku, dies.

Soon after revolutionaries disperse in smaller groups, to nearby villages. Ahsanullah Khan  from CID comes to Chittagong and cracks down on the revolutionaries. Jhunku is arrested and is severely beaten by Johnson and Ahsanullah during interrogation; he refuses to betray his leaders and comrades. He is sentenced to Kaala-Paani for life imprisonment. In due course, many revolutionaries and police officials are killed in the gun fights including noted revolutionary Nirmal Sen and police CID chief Ahsanullah. However, Pritilata Waddedar successfully attacks the Pahartali European Club and assassinates DIG Johnson; being gravely wounded she commits suicide by swallowing cyanide.

After a prolonged search, police search and arrests Master Da Surya Sen and sentences him to death by hanging. Thus Jhunku ends narrating the part and says that he was released in 1939 and again participated in the uprisings with Aparna. In one such incident there is a plan to attack the government godowns where the Britishers and feudal landlords have kept common peasant's grain. The British block all the roads to godowns leading Jhunku to an idea to create underground dungeons till the granaries. Twenty villages join hands and operate. The last scene shows Jhunku being stopped by Maj. Wilkinson who says he is still sympathetic to Jhunku and wants him to go away else he will be bound to arrest him once again. Jhunku signals to Wilkinson that everyone is awake and shows him the mass crowd arising from the dungeons and heading towards the government granaries that forces Wilkinson to retreat. This is named the Tebagha Uprising of 1945, which marked the end of British Raj in India. The film ends with the memorable song ""Ishaan.","['Action', 'Drama', 'War']","School kids organize an armed revolt in the 1930s in British occupied Chittagong. There are casualties on both sides.

Rocky meets Rani at her office. Rocky explains how Kanwal remembered Jamini suddenly a couple of days ago and that she might be a trigger for his memories.

Rani points out that the ad campaign shows women in sexist and regressive roles as the only people who cook. She says that this is why women are boycotting the brand. She comes up with the idea to run a campaign that shows men in cooking roles with the tagline ""New thinking, Same taste"".
Dhanlakshmi is now openly hostile to Rani. She says Rani thinks about herself first, while she thinks of the family. She will not allow Rani to marry Rocky. Rani accepts the challenge.
Rani knows that Gayatri does stock trading and brings her to her office to meet her editorial team. Rani believes that Gayatri can do this professionally.

Rocky apologizes and endears himself to the Chatterjee by being willing to change his patriarchal ways. Rocky explains that this is how he was brought up his parents and grandparents, but he is very willing to learn. He also points out that the Chatterjees also have biases that they have applied on him, like he is racist, misogynist, and a bad English speaker. He says that he respects Chandon as he also likes dancing but never had the courage to stand up to his father like Chandon did.
He also starts attending Chandon's dance classes.The next time a family comes to see Gayatri, they leave due to Gayatri's weird behavior. When Tijori & Dhanlakshmi confronts Gayatri, she hits back saying that her weight issue is because of them. And due to 20 kilos of extra weight they never gave her any respect. She declares that she is joining her job and will only get married when she feels like it.At the Durga Puja celebrations, Rocky and Chandon dance together to ""Dola Re Dola,"" which angers Tijori. Tijori and Dhanlakshmi walk out in the middle of the Puja. Rocky follows and Tijori insult the whole Chatterjee family, by saying that the father is a dancer, mother a drinker and the grandmother a flirt. Rani, in a fit of anger, pushes Tijori. Rocky finds it disrespectful and the two end their relationship.

He has a son who has settled in the US with his family and is least concerned about his parents. Manju wants Shambhunath to ask their son Guddu/Diwakar  to send money back home, but Shambhunath is not able to do so due to his pride.
They have to travel to an internet parlor to even Skype with Guddu, which is not convenient for them in their old age. Even then Guddu scolds them for calling him at 11 pm at night. Guddu's wife is simply not interested in having relationship with her in-laws. They have not been home in the last 6 yrs. Before Shambhunath can ask for any money, Guddu shuts the call as his daughter is getting cranky.To send his son to the USA Shambhunath took an enormous student loan  from a bank at a floating interest rate and a loan shark Prajapati Pandey  by mortgaging his house to Prajapati . The bank EMIs are automatically deducted from his pension  and sometimes he is short in paying his installment to Prajapati. At that time Diwakar had promised to pay off the loans, but now wont even look back at his parents and their misfortune.
Prajapati being a criminal thoroughly exploits Shambhunath. He brings prostitutes over to their house and has sex in their bedroom , eats meat and drinks there.. even though he knows that the Mishra's are vegetarians and don't drink.
Naina is a bubbly school-going kid, the only source of happiness in the lives of the Mishra family whose life is otherwise is tragic. She comes to their home for tuition.
Diwakar sends rs 5000 home after Manju makes a missed call to him. When Shambhunath withdraws Rs 2500 from bank, Prajapati sees him and takes Rs 2000 against his remaining EMI payment.Shakti Singh  is a corrupt cop who is on the payroll of Prajapati. However, Shakti demands higher bribes for his increased criminal activities. Prajapati is annoyed but has little choice because he is a frontman for local MLA Dada who is handling the criminal operations from behind the scenes. Prajapati does not want the matter to be escalated to Dada and has to quickly think of a way to deal with the cop.He decides to sell Shambhunath's house and threatens to vacate it in 2 days. As he is doing this he preys on Naina who is studying at his home. Shambhunath goes to the police station to file a complaint and finds Prajapati chatting with a visibly annoyed Shakti. After Prajapati leaves, Shambhunath requests Shakti to resolve his issue to which he flatly refuses. Later in the night when Shambhunath is alone at home  Prajapati arrives and assaults him. After he calms down, he tells Shambhunath to fetch Naina for him for an hour. For that he offers to forgo interest for 4 months and Rs 1.5 lakhs reduction from the principal.
This is the breaking point for Shambhunath and in a fit of rage, he stabs the throat of Prajapati with a screwdriver. When Manju returns she is shocked to find the dead Prajapati. Shambhunath calms her down and disposes of the body . He later returns to the fort, burns the jute bags, collects the bones, returns to the city and mixes the bones at a wheat flour mill.
Manju out of shock and anger stops speaking with him but she cooperates when Shakti comes for an investigation. Shakti says that Shambhunath's house was the last known location of Prajapati's cell phone.
However, Manju is shattered when Prajapati's distressed wife comes with her daughter and pleads for any information about her husband. Out of guilt Shambhunath goes to the police station and confesses his crime with a detailed description to the constable as Shakti has gone elsewhere, but the constable dismisses it as a plot from a fictional crime magazine.When Shambhunath reveals his motive for killing Prajapati, Manju fully supports and he feels guilt-free. Next day Shakti  asks him to sign a confession of murder, to which he refuses for lack of evidence. Shambhu is called by Dada, who says that he has sold his house to a buyer to recoup the loan amount and gives him 3 days to vacate. Shambhu protests that he paid the loan amount to Prajapati. So, Dada says to produce Prajapati, who is missing, and reclaim his house.
Manju and Shambhu again call Diwakar for Rs 10 lakhs, who says he cannot pay any money since he just bought a house himself in the US. He is quite insulting towards his parents and says that they are simply cooking up new excuses to take more and more money from him. Shambhu cuts the call.Shakti later meets him outside the police station  and tells him that he would absolve from murder charges if he hands him Prajapati's phone to which Shambhunath again refuses. When he reaches home, he find Prajapati's phone and goes to get a charger for it and checks the content of the Phone.
On returning he sees that Dada is forcibly vacating his house. After a showdown, Dada gives him 3 days to repay his loan. Shambhunath then finally hands over Prajapati's phone to Shakti which has a video of him having affair with Dada's wife. Shambhu confesses the crime and says that he would do this again if anyone looked at a 12 yr old girl in the wrong way, again. Manju also meets Shakti and says that if Shambhu is arrested then she would also like to go to jail. As evidence she offers the murder weapon and Prajapati's blood stained clothes that were hidden in the house.
As a part of the deal, Shakti then arrests Dada on Murder charges of Prajapati with the murder weapon and blood-stained clothes presumably recovered from the premises of Dada.After all this turmoil Shambhunath and Manju handover their house to Naina and her family who is shown to be living in an impoverished house.","['Crime', 'Drama', 'Thriller']","After their son moves to USA, a middle-class married couple is relentlessly harassed by a loan shark.","Race 3,Hum Do Hamare Do,Badhaai Do,Pagalpanti,Khatta Meetha,Murder 2"

His wife did not attend the book launch because she was not feeling well, and used to take medicines for a heart ailment. In a nearby apartment, he found Maya at the door of her flat and asked her for help when she was dumping something in the trash can. Vikram entered her flat and found the glass of the center table shattered. Maya told him that she had accidentally dropped a vase on the table. He also noticed that the bedroom door was locked from outside using a key. Maya attempted to seduce Vikram but he did not give in. The doorbell then rang and a tall man entered who Maya introduced to Vikram as her husband. Vikram finds a photo frame in the room and realizes that the man was not her husband but her lover. He attempts to flee but her lover hits him on the head with a candle holder and Vikram momentarily loses consciousness. Vikram gets up later to find her husband's body next to him and the police at the door accompanied by Maya.According to Maya's account, her doorbell rang and she answered the door to find Vikram.

Meanwhile, the police find that a gang forced sex victim named Sandhya had committed suicide recently because Vikram's second book had revealed her identity. Examination of Catherine's body reveals that she had died of a heart attack.The forensic team informs Dev that Shekhar was attacked on the head by someone while Shekhar was standing, and that the attacker must have been at least 6 feet tall. The police initially suspect Vikram as his height is 6'1"". On the second day of investigation, it is found that the photographs that were burnt were those of Maya and her lover, who was also about 6 feet tall. The photographs had been taken by a detective hired by Shekhar. The police eventually conclude that Vikram's account is true , then his shoes should be in mud as it was raining that night since 11 pm. But since the shoes were clean, Dev thinks she is lying), and that Maya and her lover had killed Shekhar when he confronted them with the photographs.

The truck hits the car and the car flips over. A man alights  and brutally kills both the driver and the lady who were in the car. The killer then takes the bodies to a factory and burns them with acid. While doing so, he accidentally spills acid on one of his own hands.Five years Later, Inspector Jatil Yadav  is seen attending the wedding of his colleague Narendra Singh  where Jatil's mother Sarita Kumari  is desperately searching for a girl to set him up with for marriage. Jatil is irritated and embarrassed and rushes his mother home to avoid further interference in his personal life. While eating dinner, Jatil gets called by the SSP Lalji Shukla IPS  to investigate a high-profile murder of a rich aristocrat named Raghuveer Singh .Jatil learns that Raghuveer was murdered by his own gun on his wedding night and is further intrigued by the family's silence and lack of knowledge on the matter. Jatil Yadav is first introduced to the family by Ramesh Chauhan , brother of Raghuveer Singh's first wife .
Members of Raghuveer's family include his two children - Karuna Singh   and Karan , Chunni  , Pramila Singh  , Vasudha  and Vikram Singh  , Ravi Sisodia  - the volatile husband of Karuna, and Radha  - the young bride of Raghuveer Singh.
Starting the interrogation, it is revealed to Jatil that Vikram was the first one to discover Raghuveer's dead body. As per Vikram's story, he went to drop off his fiance ) at around 9:30. He returned around 11:15 and then took the ladies of the house to a temple at 12:30.It was after this that Vikram says that he found his uncle Raghuveer dead. He also says that there was wedding procession crossing in-front of the house at 10:30. Jatil eventually finds out about back stairs which connects directly to a water tank and wonders if that route was used to carry out any suspicious business. Ravi is livid and blames Radha for the death and wants to throw her out of the house.
During Jatil's investigation, he begins to question Radha . Jatil develops a soft spot for her as something tells him that she is being made a scapegoat by Raghuveer's family. Radha is treated like an outsider by the family, who resents her. After first refusing to cooperate, Radha remembers something that connects her to Jatil and gives the chit to Chunni to pass to Jatil. On the chit, the address of Radha is written and he distinctly remembers that he had saved Radha five years earlier, when she attempted suicide by jumping off a train. This further leads him to believe that Radha is an innocent and emotionally disturbed girl who is getting caught in the crossfire of what seems to be developing into an insidious plot. Further into his investigation, Jatil finds out that Raghuveer's first wife was killed during a robbery when she was coming back from Gwalior towards Kanpur.Jatil also learns that Raghuveer's son Karan had once been apprehended with drugs. Jatil realizes that there's more to Raghuveer's complicated family than what meets the eye.
The next day, during the investigation, Jatil finds erotic magazines in Raghuveer's cupboard and some photos of women and a plastic bead below the bed. He also learns that Radha was sold by her father and one of the photos is of Radha with a bruised back which he found earlier. Radha continues to refrain from telling Jatil anything. Later, Munna Raja comes in after Ravi Sisodia calls him in response to Jatil's no-nonsense investigation style.
While investigating the manor, Jatil also spots a senile older woman who was earlier the maid of house. The old maid's son was the driver of the car when Raghuveer's first wife was returning from Gwalior to Kanpur and she is grandmother of Chunni. Jatil continues to investigate. Forensics tell Jatil that Raghuveer was murdered between 10pm and 12pm with his own gun and blunt marks were due to because he was hit by butt of the same gun.Phone records reveal that Vikram received a phone call from his uncle at 11:30 and many phone calls from an unknown number which is identified as Radha's. No fingerprints were found on gun or on Raghuveer's phone. Jatil is perplexed that Raghuveer was shot and no one heard a thing. This could only happen when there was a lot of noise in the house between 10 pm and 11 pm. After 11 pm the house was quiet. Yet, Vikram insists that Raghuveer called him at 11 30 PM.
Jatil takes Vikram for questioning after determining that Vikram and Radha were having an affair behind Raghuveer's back. Vikram's call records place him at the site of the murder at 11 PM as well and Jatil says that He and Radha killed Raghuveer to get him out of the way. But Vikram says that cell phone tracking is not accurate, and that he got a call from Raghuveer's phone at 11 30 PM. Jatil has no evidence. Jatil is also perplexed that there are no fingerprints on Raghuveer's phone.During an interrogation with Chunni, Jatil finds she was the one who took the lamp up to Raghuveer's room and came back with the lamp which broke down on the stairs. She also refrains from divulging anything related to the current investigation, but does say she couldn't even see her father who died in that road accident and case got closed. She indicates that the family will kill her the same way they killed her father, if she says anything.
Jatil starts investigating the death of Raghuveer's first wife and her driver. He finds that another city's police had reported a similar car and it was filed as hit and run case. The station has the evidence from the case, which includes parts of a truck. The truck markings reveal that it is from Jajmau, Kanpur. This leads him to a tannery in Jajmau which is run by a butcher, but was originally owned by Munna Raja.Further investigation into the family reveals that Karuna doesn't like her aunt Pramila and her cousin Vikram's interference since they are constantly eyeballing her. Karuna says that Pramila is ruthless and will do anything for Vikram. Later, Jatil finds a medical report and in the morning Chunni is found dead near the back stairs. He later fights with his colleague Narendra  and openly tells the SSP that he will find the truth. Later he is attacked by the goons and calls Narendra for help, but Narendra ignores him and he tells him that he is going to arrest Radha. Jatil immediately warns Radha to run, but before she can run away Ravi chases her and she locks herself in a room. Jatil comes in time to take her away, but goons continue to chase them. They are able to catch a train though unknown to them one of the goons  also catches the train. Later in the night Radha wakes up to see Jatil is missing. She takes her knife with her and finds Jatil being attacked by the Butcher working for Munna Raja. Both overpower the Butcher and throw him out of the train. Jatil and Radha reach Raghuveer's Gwalior farmhouse. During this time Narendra Singh is investigating the murder of Chunni and forensics tells him about the dead skin found in her fingernails leading him to the conclusion that the suspect is a man with burnt skin.Narendra makes the report and goes to SSP, but he sees the man having fingernail marks on burnt hand in the office of SSP with Munna Raja. He goes to Chunni's grandmother and shows her the photo of the man. He informs about all of this to Jatil. In the meantime Jatil finds a piece of a dress in Radha's bag having the same bead he found earlier, he confronts her that she was in fact in the room and she lied, she confesses that she and Vikram had an affair and planned to elope with Vikram but he didn't as he planned to marry MLA's daughter, seeing this she got furious and called Vikram to come and talk, he returned as soon as he dropped his fiance and parked the car and without anyone noticing took the back stairs and confronted Radha. As she was going to enter the room to tell Raghuveer about the affair, the lights went out and Chunni comes upstairs with the lamp. As the electricity comes back, they all find Raghuveer already dead. Vikram tells her to go downstairs and meanwhile Vikram tells Chunni to call on his cell from Raghuveer's phone.After this, while returning Chunni drops the lamp on the stairs. Vikram takes the backstairs and returns by the main gate and asks the women to come to go for the temple. Later Jatil informs SSP that he has made Radha surrender in another police station.
Jatil finally gets time to open the medical report and finds the medical report under the name of Raghuveer's first wife and report was of abortion, and abortion was done one day before the accident. He inquires about it from her brother Ramesh who tells him that she was here with him as Karan caught malaria but left all of a sudden to Kanpur. Ramesh had called his sister that night on phone, and says he heard horns of the train but contradicting to this she was travelling by car.
Jatil also inquired the caretaker of the farmhouse who told that she ordered him to call whenever Raghuveer came with another woman. Investigating the farmhouse, he finds the same erotic magazines, Polaroid photos, Polaroid camera and a badge of a boarding school. He visits the abortion clinic as well and watches the wedding video, too.He learns that Radha is being taken by police under the bridge on the orders of SSP. As Radha is being taken by Narendra Singh under the bridge the same van comes who were chasing Jatil with the butcher in it. The butcher comes out and inspect the van as he opens the van to take out Radha, Jatil who all along was accompanying her  comes out and attacks resulting in cross-firing in which Radha gets injured but butcher escapes. As soon as butcher reaches his home Chunni's grandmother comes from back and throws oil onto him and burns him alive.In the climax, Radha comes with Jatil in the bungalow with everyone present he starts to tell the truth, He confronts Ravi Sisodia first that he is one who gave drugs to Karan and later the school caught him and Raghuveer bailed him out. It was in fact the butcher who killed both Raghuveer's first wife and driver and burnt the bodies in the tannery on the orders of Munna Raja. Mrs. Raghuveer was tipped off by the caretaker about a female whom Raghuveer brought in the farmhouse. On peeping through a window, Mrs. Raghuveer finds out the woman is none other than Vasudha, Pramila's daughter. Vasudha was sexually abused many times by her uncle Raghuveer who took perverse photos of her and forced himself upon her. As a result of Vasudha's abortion, she was expelled from school. The school informed the local guardian of Vasudha, who was Raghubeer himself.
Abortion was on 14th. Vasudha was suspended on 15th and the same night Mrs Raghubeer and her driver were killed. On 16th Chunni filed a missing report for her father . The case got closed without due investigation.It is revealed that Vasudha killed her uncle because when she confronted him with the truth, he dismissed her claims and insulted her and asked her to kill herself. In a fit of rage, Vasudha she takes out his gun and shoot him point blank. Later, Vasudha takes out her dress cloth and puts it in the Radha's bag. The change of dress cloth is noticed by Jatil in the wedding video while he is surveying the footage for clues.

Champak's daughter Tarika  has always harbored a dream to travel and study abroad.

Bittoo's friend, the Videographer at the wedding, pretends that Bittoo is part of the film crew and has a right to be there. After watching her dance at the wedding, Bittoo makes a video of her during the dance routine. The next day he figures out her name and college and chases her down to give her the DVD to impress her. She accepts it and tells him her dream of opening a wedding-planning company.After exams are over Shruti makes a deal with her parents that she has five years to get her business up and running before they arrange a marriage for her. When Bittoo's father comes to take him back to his village to work chopping sugar cane, Bittoo refuses and lies that he and Shruti are going into business together. He goes to Shruti with this idea but she refuses because she was worried that a romantic complication would rise between the two of them. She tells Bittoo that the number one rule of business is not to let love get in the way. Bittoo promises that that will never be a problem. Shruti still refuses but Bittoo follows her around anyways.Shruti goes to meet with Chanda, a famous wedding planner, in the hopes that Chanda will hire her and teach her about ""high-class weddings."" However, too over-eager, Shruti ruins her chance at getting hired and is just about to be thrown out when Chanda sees Bittoo waiting for her. Needing a strong person for heavy lifting, Chanda offers him a job. Bittoo accepts with the condition that she hires Shruti as well, saying that they are partners and refusing to work without her. Chanda agrees and the two of them get to work helping with the wedding. While checking the arrangements, Shruti learns that Chanda is cheating her clients - she orders a cheaper arrangement of flowers and decorations than the family requested so she can keep more of the commission.

Knowing that he is worried about what happened, Shruti tries to reassure Bitto that she's not like other women he's been with who follow him around everywhere. Bittoo, misunderstanding, believes that she's telling him that the night didn't mean anything to her. Relieved, he tells her it meant nothing to him as well, citing her own rule that business and love don't mix. Shruti pretends to agree but cries after he leaves. This creates a tense atmosphere between the two, eventually leading to Shruti making a mistake with the sound board at a wedding. They have a huge fight resulting in Shruti breaking the partnership and forcing Bittoo to leave the company. Bittoo vows to start his own wedding planning business and the two go their separate ways. Both of them attempt to prove themselves in the industry while badmouthing the other's business to clients. However, they don't do as well by themselves, unable to handle the workload without their partner and both enterprises end up suffering huge losses, plunging them into debt.Shruti is forced into a situation of even sharing bed with men if she failed to pay.They finally get a big contract, but it is contingent upon them working together as a team.

When the lead entertainer is forced to back out at the last minute due to suffering an injury, Bittoo and Shruti perform together for the wedding, something they hadn't done since before their falling out. The performance is a success and the next day, Bittoo tells Shruti that they should be partners again, saying that Shaadi Mubarak was never as successful as when they were together. Shruti refuses his offer, telling him that she is getting married in two months to her fiance, Chetan, and will move to Dubai with him after the wedding. Bittoo is stunned and immediately argues with her that she can't get married, saying it it is ""totally wrong.""During the rest of the wedding preparations Bittoo pesters Shruti about her engagement, claiming that she'd be moving too far from her mother and father, or that Dubai wouldn't suit her. When none of those reason dissuade her, Bittoo asks if her engagement was an attempt to make him jealous, claiming that she'd fallen in love with him and that this marriage was a way to get revenge because he paid her no heed after their night together. Shruti refuses to answer. He finally goes too far when he cuts off a call from Chetan in a effort to get Shruti to answer his question. Livid, Shruti answers that she is not doing it for revenge, but for her own security and her parents' satisfaction to see her well-settled in life. She admits that she did fall in love with Bittoo, but since he didn't feel the same, she had moved on. Shruti answers a call from Chetan and walks away sadly, leaving Bittoo alone.At the sudden thought of losing her forever, Bittoo realizes that he has always been in love with Shruti, but was too scared to acknowledge it in fear of jeopardizing the business. Desperate to win her back, Bittoo steals Chetan's phone number from Shruti's cell and calls him, telling him to back off and that Shruti was his. Hearing what Bittoo had done from Cheten, Shruti angrily runs off to find Bittoo and confronts him where he is waiting for her on a rooftop.

Sanjay orders not to engage until he arrives, but a restless K.K.  proceeds with some officers. Sanjay arrives and upon hearing the gunshots, decides to engage. The building is cleared, and K.K. is found shot down. Sanjay enters the room and there's more shooting, as a result of which 2 students end up dead, 2 escape and 1 is arrested alive. Sanjay now starts facing the heat from media and politicians who start billing the encounter as a fake one. They're joined by the whole nation in condemning the Delhi Police and everyone starts demanding justice for the students who were supposedly killed to account for the bombings. Sanjay's wife Nandita , a news anchor, is however unwilling to accept this and decides to stay with Sanjay, who soon becomes diagnosed with Posttraumatic stress disorder, frequently hallucinating about getting shot by the terrorists. Nandita somehow stops him whenever he becomes suicidal.Sanjay now starts looking for the 2 terrorists that escaped, and finds one of them to hiding in Nizampur. Sanjay is informed by his senior that he would be awarded for the encounter and that he must celebrate. Realizing he's not been told where to celebrate, he heads to Nizampur where he manages to find Dilshad, one of the fugitives. Everyone tries to stop Sanjay, who chases, beats up and almost arrests Dilshad, only to be cornered by the politicians and public who let him escape but without Dilshad.
After being awarded the President Medal, Sanjay begins his hunt again  and this time, through Dilshad's girlfriend Huma , tricks him into coming to Nepal . Dilshad is planning to leave for Dubai via Nepal  and Sanjay plans to nab him in Nepal by using Huma. He knows that Huma is an illegal Russian immigrant and threatens to deport her, unless she delivers Dilshad to him.Huma tells Sanjay how Dilshad is expecting a call from Dubai. So Sanjay gets his colleague to call  instead and give instructions for pickup in Nepal.
He teams up with his officers once again, and sends a van to pick up Dilshad, as a part of his plan. The latter, however, sends someone else to check for anything suspicious. Sanjay runs to stop his officers from engaging upon realizing Dilshad's not in the van and lets it flee. Learning of nothing suspicious, Dilshad informs the van driver he'd depart the next day, and upon landing in Nepal, is stopped, thrashed and arrested by Sanjay and his team.The court proceedings begin, where the opposing lawyer  brings up arguments to counter Sanjay's truth and creates a fake encounter story, as per which K.K. and his men brought the students in L18, tortured and decided to kill them when they were ordered not to do so, following which K.K. was shot by one of his officers. The lawyer also proves that nobody except the dead KK actually saw Dilshad escape from the apartment where the shootout took place.
Sanjay, however, brings out the truth that actually his officers had been closely watching the students and realized they belonged to the Indian Mujahideen. The real shootout then plays out, showcasing K.K. and his team engaging when the students fire, and the very fact that K.K. died gives Sanjay's argument a strong support when he tells everyone that no officer has ever died in a fake encounter. His arguments convince the court to sentence the 2 terrorists to life imprisonment, while the last one somehow escapes the country.While sections of the media still oppose the ruling and believe the police to be culprits, a video clip that surfaced in 2016 featured a confession from the terrorist who had escaped the encounter, about he managed to do so and later join the ISIS, further confirming the credibility of the encounter.","['Action', 'Crime', 'Drama', 'History', 'Thriller']","In 2008, a violent shootout with terror suspects leaves one police officer struggling to hunt down the fugitives and justify the police action.","Singham Returns,Singham,Dishoom,India&apos;s Most Wanted,Talvar,Vikram Vedha"

10916102,Bahut Hua Sammaan,Comedy Crime Drama RDIN Lovely locker bag room police car college water learn farmhouse rob enter men,Comedy Crime Drama Kohinoor wrong witness planned heist inextricably involved pursuit possibly biggest scandal country,"The film starts with two men fighting over a car dent. In anger, one of them breaks the window of the other's car, and they fight in a humorously eccentric manner. The owner of the damaged car takes out a bag, and both of them leave the scene. Later, we learn that the two are Fundoo  and Bony , and that they staged this act together to steal the bag from the car without attracting suspicion. They sell the bag to Chandu, the college's con man.

Fundoo and Bonny failed their final year of mechanical engineering training and are unable to graduate. The college's graduates throw a party to celebrate their new jobs, and Fundoo and Bony attend this party. But they become envious and leave, and soon cross paths with Baba  who thinks of himself as a Robin Hood fighting the societal faults of capitalism with his comrades. Baba convinced them to rob a branch of the college bank and gives them a map of it. Specifically, Baba tells them to rob the locker room, which has cash and jewelry worth around 30,000,000 rupees .

Fundoo and Bonny discuss various plans, but ultimately decide to rob the bank by entering through the water pipes below the locker room and using a machine to cut the room's steel flooring. They ask Chandu to give them some men to assist, and he provides them with Raju and Bhola. But after they make fun of Fundoo and Bonny, Fundoo and Bonny send them away and decide to execute the plan by themselves after all.

They ask Chandu to turn off the water supply for 24 hours under the guise of water conservation so that they can enter the locker room through the pipes safely. Baba instructs them to rob the locker of PMS  as he believes this locker has something valuable. Unfortunately, the water supply was only cut for 8 hours instead of 24, and when they are about to enter the locker room, the water starts flowing again. Nevertheless, they manage to enter the locker room, only to find that PMS is there with some police officers, and that several of the lockers are broken. The police arrest Fundoo and Bonny, who are then interrogated by officer Bobby . We learn that Bobby is trying hard to have a child with her husband Rajat . Bobby tortures Fundoo and Bony using a machine consisting of pulleys and levers, which Bobby was able to set up because she was also a mechanical engineering student in the same college.

PMS informs Netaji about the robbery, explaining that his locker has been looted and the Kohinoor that was inside it is now gone. Netaji slaps PMS and the mood grows tense. Netaji then meets with Baba Ji of the company Akhand Bharat Sansthan. Baba Ji warns Netaji that if he suffers harm to his reputation, he will not let Netaji win the next election. Netaji promises him that he will find the Kohinoor, and he hires ex-commando Lovely Singh to help him.

The police ask Fundoo and Bonny to identify the robbers via security camera footage, and they identify Bhola and Raju. The police arrest Chandu, who earlier in the film introduced these two men to Fundoo and Bonny, but Chandu reveals that he doesn't know anything about the plot.

Meanwhile, Bholu and Raju call their boss Baalu Bhaiya. We learn that they had earlier caused a major financial loss to Baalu's business, and that they robbed the bank in order to pay back the loss and rebuild trust. Baalu Bhaiya asks them to meet him at Sapna's farmhouse . However, Baalu Bhaiya sends his men there to kill Bholu and Raju, and once they arrive, they capture Sapna and ask her about Bholu and Raju. Bholu and Raju overhear this conversation and try to save Sapna. In the midst of the shooting, Bholu and Raju drop the bag with the robbed items, Sapna picks it up, and they all flee.

Meanwhile, Lovely Singh is searching for the bag and questions Baalu Bhaiya, but when he does not get any information, he kills Baalu. Fundoo and Bony are released on bail with the help of Baba. Lovely reaches Sapna and checks the bag with the stolen items but doesn't find the Kohinoor. He asks her to call Raju and Bholu to set up a meeting, and they ask her to come back to the old farmhouse outside the village. The call was taped by the police. Lovely kills Sapna after learning all the information he wanted from her.

When Raju and Bhola arrive at the farmhouse, the police arrest them and put them in jail. At the jail, Baba asks for the whereabouts of the Kohinoor in exchange for telling them where Sapna is. They reveal to Baba that it is in the jeep near the farmhouse. Baba asks Fundoo and Bony to accompany him there. They at first refuse, but their eagerness for riches ultimately leads them to agree. Lovely overhears Baba's conversation with Raju and Bhola and gets to the farmhouse before them.

Lovely gets the bag and then tries to kill the two. Baba saves them but gets shot. Fundoo and Bony get the Kohinoor, which is a diary that describes how much money Akhand Bharat gave to the union minister as well as a chemical formula. They take the diary to Bobby, who questions PMS to learn that the chemical formula of for a substance that is put in all the products of Akhand Bharat Sansthan so that people get addicted to them. PMS reveals the location of the lab where this chemical is produced. Bobby had planned a vacation with Rajat to Manali to plan a baby, but cancels the trip and instead takes him to Gorakhpur to investigate Akhand Bharat Sansthan's lab. Before leaving, she finds Rajat's fertility report, which says that Rajat can never become a father. They learned the location of the lab in PMS's interrogation.

Meanwhile, we learn that Baba is alive; he decides to take revenge on Lovely and gets his weapons ready. As Bobby and our two protagonists enter the lab, Fundoo and Bony come under the influence of a toxic biochemical, lose their senses, and start to hallucinate. Lovely arrives, hoping to get the Kohinoor back, and tries to kill all three of them. But Baba arrives just in time to save them and kills Lovely, thus achieving his revenge. Seeing Baba's heroic act, Bobby decides to make him her sperm donor for in vitro fertilization. A few days later, Akhand Bharat Sansthan's wicked deeds are exposed and Babaji is sent to jail. When Baba asks Fundoo and Bony about their future plans, they reveal that they made a fortune by short-selling shares of Akhand Bharat, and now they are wealthy. Bobby soon delivers a baby girl.

28282716,Trial Period,Comedy Drama n’t uncle time Choudh ted round tri period job ble bout school rted cool role,Comedy Drama mother working single world turns upside inquisitive son demands papa,"Anamaya Roy Choudhary or Ana, is a hardworking single mother living in Delhi with her six-year-old son Romi. Their lives revolve around a packed routine that balances both Ana's career and her son’s upbringing. However, when Romi is tasked with talking about his non-existent father at school, his curiosity sparks a unique idea — he demands a new papa on a 30-day trial period. This idea was most likely inspired by his mother's maternal uncle who watched advertisements of products being given on a trial period.

On the other hand, Prajapti 'PD' Dwivedi, is a simple yet affable man from Ujjain, who is looking for a job and arrives in Delhi at his paternal uncle's office while Ana is searching for a father on Romi's request.

The story shows how PD, an educated, unemployed man adjusts into the environment created by Ana, a single yet hardworking mother and Romi. 


Anamaya lives in Delhi. She divorced her husband and cares for her son, Romi, alone. Well, Romi’s uncle and aunt live right around the corner in the neighborhood and help raise Romi when she goes off to work, but Romi is still missing a vital ingredient in his life. Romi feels it first when he has to recite a poem about his father in school on Father’s Day. He failed miserably, and from that day on, the quest for a figure called Papa started to grip his mind. He got obsessed with having a father. Ana was divorced and tried to convince him that he didn’t really need a ‘papa,’ as they are boring, grumpy, authoritarian, and ‘uncool.’ She didn’t know that Romi was a bright kid with a highly fertile imagination, and in his imagination, he saw fathers as superheroes and hence would go to any lengths to get one for himself.

One fine day, Romi asked his uncle to switch on the TV and call the teleshopping channel the uncle was so fond of. Romi stubbornly requested that he order a ‘papa’ from the teleshopping channel. He did so because the teleshopping channel had a policy of a ‘trial period,’ meaning the order could be returned if it didn’t meet the buyer’s expectations. Everybody was shocked. Romi wanted his father around, but as Ana explained that he couldn’t be around, he imagined the scenario of ordering one, as if fathers were available wholesale! Romi’s Uncle and Aunt try to make him understand that fathers are not a ‘commodity’ that can be bought, but Romi gets fixated on the idea. Ana gets concerned, but as she is a cool mother, she tries to play along and tries to find a man who will play the role of Romi’s father for a trial period of one month.

While the Choudhry household was trying to find a father for the limited time roleplay, Prajapati Dwivedi had just arrived in Delhi in search of a job. He was from a small town but was a highly educated fellow. He felt like a fish out of water but felt that it was just a matter of time before someone would recognize his talents and give him a job. He had just one contact in the city, and that was his uncle, who ran a job placement agency. They recruited highly talented people and recommended them to employers across various sectors. Prajapati wanted to be a Professor of history, but jobs were scarce, and his uncle couldn’t get him a job. Penniless, he was offered a stay in the office, but soon his idiosyncrasies started to disturb his uncle. He wanted to get rid of him, and when Romi’s Uncle ended up with his unusual request, he saw how to deal with Prajapati.

Actually, Ana had tried her luck everywhere but couldn’t find a man who would act as Romi’s father for a month. When they all heard of the situation, they started to reveal very quickly that their real desire was to be with Ana. They weren’t interested in the role at all. Ana was not looking for a relationship, and fed up with the parade of men interested in her, she nearly dropped the whole plan. This was when Romi’s uncle came to help. He knew Prajapati’s uncle even before he stepped foot in Delhi. He took Ana to the job placement office and asked Prajapati’s uncle to find a suitable candidate for their charade. At first, he was perplexed but realized that Prajapati could be the solution to everyone’s problem.

Prajapati was not too keen on taking on the role of a father, even if it was just role play. He didn’t understand the whole concept, yet he had no choice. Living in the office was getting unbearable, and at least now he would get a room of his own. He agreed to act as Romi’s Papa but was given strict instructions that he was to be the grumpy and uncool Papa, not the smart and cool one. He had not understood the assignment completely. It was just that if anybody had to gel with him, they would have to spend some time with him, and he would charm them with his knowledge and his wealth of stories.

At first, Ana was happy that she had found the perfect candidate. He wasn’t interested in Romi’s superheroes or his charades. Romi started to become disenchanted much more quickly than she anticipated. But one day, Prajapati took Romi to his swimming class and showed off his swimming skills, which impressed Romi to no end. He came back and was genuinely thrilled to have a ‘cool papa.’ Ana grew concerned and started to watch Prajapati’s behavior. She couldn’t afford Romi getting too attached to him. She stopped him from going to see Romi’s football match out of her concern that he would not act the part of the grumpy father and that Romi would grow more and more fascinated with him. Had she allowed him to go, Romi wouldn’t have been bullied the way he was in his school.

After returning from the football match, Prajapati saw bruises on Romi’s body and gave him combat tricks to take down the bullies the next day. Ana came to know about Romi’s violence in school and thought that it was Prajapati who had incited him. He confronted him and called him a goon. Prajapati was an honorable man who understood that standing up for oneself in a fight wasn’t violence, and Ana had to understand that. Prajapati, in turn, forced Ana to see Romi’s bruised body, and she realized she was wrong to criticize him. She didn’t hold back and gave an ultimatum to the bully’s mother, and Romi saw the heated exchange. He saw a family fighting for him and felt empowered for the first time, meaning no one could bully him like before. Ana apologized to Prajapati, and he understood her predicament. She was a single mother who had no time for herself, and Romi didn’t want to add to her troubles, which is why he kept mum about the bullying. With Prajapati around to take care of Romi, Ana found the time to live for herself a bit. She went out to party while Romi spent his time with his ‘cool papa.’

What pained her heart was that she didn’t get a chance to share her true feelings. All was not lost, as Prajapati remembered Romi’s annual concert and showed up at his school to boost his confidence. Ana and Prajapati met again and finally shared their true feelings. The ‘rented’ Prajapati was now to become a permanent member of Romi and Ana’s family. While Ana had raised him well, it was Prajapati who gave Romi the love of a father, which was missing in his life. Prajapati was a good soul himself, and although he had his idiosyncrasies, he was a role model for Romi to grow up around. Ana, too, found a loving and caring partner who was as intelligent as she was, and that too out of a “Trial Period”!

13131350,Vikram Vedha,Action Crime Drama Thriller kill unit killed encounter finds kills police gangster criminal story act dreaded friend orders unarmed,Action Crime Drama Thriller gangster tough police officer sets track kill equally,"SSP Vikram is an honest police officer, who has a black-and-white sense of good and evil. Vedha Betal is a dreaded gangster from Kanpur who understands the nuance in between. Vikram's best friend SSP Abbas leads an encounter unit in the STF, which is formed to eliminate Vedha. In one encounter, the squad kills some of Vedha's henchmen, framing an unarmed criminal killed by Vikram to avoid further inquiry. As the unit plans another encounter, Vedha Betal enters the police station and voluntarily surrenders. When Vikram interrogates Vedha, he offers to narrate a story to him. The first act relates about Vedha becoming a dreaded gangster, who warns his younger brother Shatak, who is a mathematical genius, to stay away from crime, but Shatak is forced by a rival gangster, Babloo to carry drugs. When Shatak and his friend Chanda are caught by the police, Shatak confesses and Babloo is arrested.

On his boss Shiv Prasad's orders, Babloo assaults Shatak, leaving a permanent scar on his hand. Vedha asks Vikram if he should kill Babloo or Shiv Prasad. Vikram replies that Shiv Prasad was the real culprit, to which Vedha implies that he killed Shiv Prasad. Vedha's lawyer, who turns out to be Vikram's wife Priya, intervenes and bails him out. Vikram realises that the unarmed criminal framed by them for avoiding inquiry was actually Shatak, based on the mark in his hand. Worried that Vedha might try to kill Abbas, Vikram rushes to save Abbas, but finds him and Chanda shot dead. The IG dismisses it as a botched encounter. Priya refuses to divulge Vedha's whereabouts to Vikram. Enraged by this, Vikram raids Vedha's tenements and manages to capture him. Vedha requests Vikram to listen to another story.

The second act relates with Shatak now grown-up, offering to launder Vedha's income by investing it in shares. Vedha's boss Parshuram Pandey invests ₹1 crore  in this venture. However, Chanda is supposedly kidnapped and the money is missing. Chanda returns and reveals that she stole the money to start a new life, but came back because she loves Shatak. Vedha returns the money to Pandey, who orders him to kill Chanda. Vedha asks Vikram if he should respect Pandey and carry out the order or disobey him and support Shatak and Chanda, thus inciting a gang war. Vikram replies that he should support Shatak to which Vedha agrees. Realizing Shatak's innocence causes Vikram to stumble momentarily, at which point Vedha attacks and subdues him, telling him to investigate Shatak's and Abbas's deaths.

Vikram begins his investigation with Abbas's informant, who led them to Shatak's hideout, but finds that the informant has been killed. He and his unit tries to find the killer. Vikram takes a moment to recollect when he finds the leader of the Mumbai Gang from Vedha's story. He apprehends and fights him only for the gang leader to almost kill Vikram before getting shot and killed by his unit member Deepak. Vikram searches his room, but finds a cigar where he finds that the cigarette is filled with marijuana instead of tobacco. Vikram deduces that Babloo is behind the encounter and informs Vedha at his restaurant, who brings Babloo to an abandoned factory. Vikram arrives and meets Vedha, who tells the third and final act to Vikram. Vedha had sent Shatak and Chanda to Mumbai. He noticed that only his men, except Pandey's are being targeted and eliminated by the cops.

On Babloo's confession, Vedha tells that Abbas was bribed by Babloo to kill his men, where he asks Vikram if Abbas was right, since he became corrupt to pay for his son's medical procedure. Vedha kills Babloo leaving Vikram frustrated on finding out who had killed Abbas. The IG and the unit arrive, who castigates Vikram for letting Vedha escape again. Vikram slowly realises that the entire unit had also been bribed by Babloo. IG reveals that Babloo paid them to kill Vedha and Chanda's abduction was intended to lure Shatak out of Mumbai, which would lure Vedha out of hiding. However, a guilt-ridden Abbas had gone to save Chanda, but the unit had killed them both. As the unit prepares to kill Vikram, Vedha reappears and saves him. A gunfight ensues, and Vikram disables all his colleagues with Vedha's help, but kills the IG. Vikram asks Vedha if he should let him go for saving his life or kill him since he is a criminal where a standoff ensues between Vikram and Vedha.","['Action', 'Crime', 'Drama', 'Thriller']",A tough police officer sets out to track down and kill an equally tough gangster.,"Satyameva Jayate,Saaho,Singham,Ittefaq,HIT: The First Case,Holiday"

315642,Wazir,Action Crime Drama Mystery Thriller named chess police bad time hurt made man van meet friends daughter find called back,Action Crime Drama Mystery Thriller lives grief-stricken cop amputee grandmaster brought peculiar twist fate part wider conspiracy darkened,"Once upon a time, there was a police officer named Danish Ali. He had a wife named Ruhana and a little daughter named Noorie. One day, while they were all driving together, Danish saw a bad person named Farooq Rameez and tried to catch him. But sadly, Noorie got hurt and passed away during the chase, while Rameez got away. Ruhana was very sad and blamed Danish for Noorie's death. Later on, Danish caught and killed Rameez, but his bosses at work were mad because they wanted Rameez alive to find out who he was going to meet. So, Danish got in trouble and was not allowed to work anymore.

A sad man named Danish is really upset and wants to hurt himself at his friend Noorie's grave. But then, a strange van shows up and drives away when Danish yells at it. Danish sees a wallet where the van was and decides to return it to its owner. The owner turns out to be a man named Pandit, who is really good at playing chess and used to teach Noorie. Pandit starts teaching Danish how to play chess too. Pandit tells Danish about his own daughter, Nina, who also died. Nina was teaching chess to a girl named Ruhi, who is the daughter of an important government person called Qureshi. Nina died after falling down some stairs at Qureshi's house, and Pandit thinks it wasn't an accident. Danish gets curious and tries to meet Qureshi, but the police at Qureshi's office threaten to arrest him. Later, Danish goes to Ruhi's school to ask her about Nina, but Qureshi takes Ruhi away and threatens her for talking to Danish. That night, Pandit gets hurt really badly by a man named Wazir, who is a hired killer working for Qureshi. Wazir warns Pandit and Danish to stop looking into Qureshi's actions.

Pandit goes to Kashmir and Qureshi is going there too. Wazir calls Danish and threatens to hurt Pandit. Danish tries really hard to catch up to Pandit's van, but Wazir blows it up and Pandit dies. Danish gets really angry and wants to get back at Wazir and find out who he is. He goes to Kashmir without telling Ruhana and makes a plan with the police superintendent, Vijay Malik. During Qureshi's speech, Malik sets off explosives that were hidden in a chandelier, causing chaos. He holds back the police so Danish can do something. Qureshi runs away and goes to where he and Ruhi are staying, but Danish breaks in and asks him about Wazir. Qureshi says he doesn't know anyone named Wazir, but Ruhi starts crying and tells Danish that Qureshi is not her real father. He is actually one of the bad guys who killed everyone in her village and pretended to be her dad. Ruhi had told Nina this, so Qureshi killed Nina and made it look like an accident. Danish realizes that Rameez and the other bad guys came to meet Qureshi, so he kills him. Later, the police and Ruhi tell the news that Qureshi was actually a bad guy.

A few days later, Danish was watching a play that Ruhana was in. The play was about chess and dedicated to someone named Pandit. While watching, Danish suddenly realized that Pandit was actually like a weak chess piece called a pawn, who had become friends with a strong piece called a rook . They were planning to defeat a bad king named Qureshi and get revenge. Danish was very surprised by this realization. He went to talk to Pandit's housekeeper, who said she didn't see the person named Wazir who attacked Pandit. But she did remember that Pandit had told her to give Danish a USB pen-drive if he ever came looking for Wazir. The pen-drive had a video of Pandit explaining that Wazir was not a real person, but just a character that Pandit made up. Pandit knew that he couldn't fight against Qureshi because of his disability, so he made up Wazir to help him. Pandit purposely dropped his wallet near Noorie's grave so that Danish would find it and become friends with him. The knife wounds from Wazir's attack were actually made by Pandit himself, and he used recordings of his voice to pretend to be Wazir on the phone. Pandit sacrificed himself so that Danish could kill Qureshi and get revenge for both of them. Danish was very shocked by this revelation, but he and Ruhana were able to come back together and be friends again.","['Action', 'Crime', 'Drama', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']",A grief-stricken cop and an amputee grandmaster are brought together by a peculiar twist of fate as part of a wider conspiracy that has darkened their lives.,"Saaho,Ittefaq,Wajah Tum Ho,Badla,Dishoom,Dial 100"

Fallen out of help with the police due to his restless nature, Sameer approaches the Indian embassy, where he poses as an employee of a telecom company and acquires the address of the person from whose phone Nargis contacted him, which turns out to be a man named Shirazi. Sameer and Usman learn about Shirazi's involvement in the human trafficking. Sameer visits brothels with Usman in search of Nargis and finds her, but he is attacked by the owners and Sameer turns violent, where he kills the men and a car chase ensues which results in Sameer getting arrest by the Indian Embassy cops.

Sameer narrates the incident to the cops, where he is approached by a Nomani cop named Faiz Abu Malik who decides to help him with officer Tamena joining along. They view the CCTV footage of the Noman airport, where they see Nargis entering a van with a man revealed to be Iztek, an Algerian modelling coordinator. Iztek orders that Nargis be killed. Faiz and Tamena come across a burnt corpse and believe it to be Nargis. Sameer sees her pendant and is shattered. Following her funeral, Sameer is given compensation and tickets to India. Tamena learns Nargis is alive and the corpse they found was of a different woman. Tamena and Faiz try to find Sameer only to find that he never boarded the flight. Baying for revenge, Sameer arrives at Iztek's house and two violently fight before Iztek reveals Nargis is alive. Faiz and Tamena arrive where Faiz is revealed to be Iztek's ally.

Tamena subdues Faiz long enough to buy Sameer time to escape. Faiz kills Tamena and frames Sameer. An ensuing chase leaves Iztek dead. Faiz meets his crime partner and Iztek's boss, which is photographed by an undercover cop. Sameer is captured by Faiz before his betrayal is revealed by the commissioner. Sameer and Faiz engage in a fistfight where Sameer thrashes Faiz. Nargis and the other women are freed and Tamena is given a state funeral. Faiz wakes up in the middle of a desert in front of firing squad for his crimes, where they shoot him to death. Sameer and Nargis prepare to depart the plane for India while making the last meeting with Usman. Sameer invites Usman to arrive and meet them at India as they greet him before leaving.","['Action', 'Crime', 'Drama', 'Thriller']",A newly married couple's life falls in jeopardy when the wife goes missing under mysterious circumstances.,"Mere Dad Ki Maruti,Badla,Kahaani,Murder 2,Bamfaad,Lupt"

6354784,The Hungry,Drama movie murder bathtub son events revenge played play marriage party family cut implied man horribly wrong,Drama set contemporary adaptation tragedy wedding politics business retelling extravagant surroundings whilst exploring role patriarch corruption big,"A New Year's party at the start of the movie goes horribly wrong when the young and good-looking scion of the Joshi family is found in the bathtub, his wrists cut, and suicide implied. This is on the eve of his marriage to the daughter of Tathigat Ahuja played by Naseeerudin Shah, who seems to the relish the relatively rare opportunity to play a villain, giving the movie its homicidal edge.Tulsi Joshi, the single mother of the man in the bathtub, is played by Tisca Chopra, who delivers a smoking hot performance. She is a woman with her back to the wall but bent on revenge for her son's murder, for she suspects foul play from the word go. Conspiring with Tathagat's right hand man , who she has managed to wrap around her little finger, she plots and schemes as Tathagat is released from jail on an unrelated offence two years after the sequence that begins the movie.All this is set in the backdrop of Tulsi's marriage to the much younger son of Tathagat - the bumbling, dimwitted Sunny  at the sprawling Ahuja estate. The plot grows markedly murkier as the sexy daughter of Tathagat, Loveleen , who is his favourite, decides to go on a drinking spree with Tulsi's other son, Chirag . Intoxicated and with a burning desire to extract revenge, Chirag bashes up Loveleen, smashing her face in beyond recognition. Watching Loveleen escape provides some of the movie's most harrowing and indelible scenes.Tulsi's desire for revenge is portrayed by Chatterjee with a generous dose of sympathy and her cause is shown as being relatively right compared to Tathagat's ruthless hunger for power and money. Chopra's performance matches the Bollywood veteran Shah's delectable turn step for step, with both actors enjoying their roles even as their on-screen versions set in motion a chain of events that can only end in murder and mayhem. It is clear from the start that she is quietly desperate in sharp contrast to Tathagat's cool, methodical ways.The film may work well as a dark tragedy, but Shakespeare's larger point of the emptiness and sometimes self-destructiveness of the soul and human psyche is a bit lost. The opening sequence is returned to multiple times, as Chatterjee reveals the machinations behind the murder in slow, excruciating detail. This may have been done for the chills but it is clear who is behind the opening murder and so the point of the flashbacks was lost on this reviewer.Some scenes are unevenly directed and the scene is which Tathagat is shaven by his barber is a downright cliché. But then the scene that follows is a redemption of proceedings, as Shah screams at a few workers for not buying enough marigolds for the wedding with malevolent evil, even as crucial corporate documents bringing about the merger of the two empires - the Ahujas and Joshis - are being signed .There is a certain deliberateness to the way Chatterjee directs that makes us forget the movie's minor flaws; not a movie to fall in love with, but perhaps held and admired from a distance.Shared by: Farhan Wilayat Butt",['Drama'],"An adaptation of William Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus set in contemporary New Delhi.

The night before the flight, he indulged in revelry and alcohol consumption, leading to his fatigue upon boarding. His co-pilot for the journey was Tanya Albuquerque. The flight faced an unexpected hurdle as a cyclone in Cochin prompted discussions of diversion to an alternate airport. Captain Khanna opted for Trivandrum as the diversion point, despite Albuquerque's reservations. She argued that Bengaluru would be a more suitable backup due to Trivandrum's proximity to Cochin and the likelihood of adverse weather conditions there. Khanna, however, insisted that the flight divert to Trivandrum, emphasizing fuel conservation.

Regrettably, due to miscommunication and a lack of awareness, the flight crew was unaware that Trivandrum was experiencing weather conditions as severe as, if not worse than, Cochin. These conditions severely compromised visibility. Nonetheless, Captain Khanna displayed remarkable skill and nerve, executing a landing at Trivandrum with his eyes metaphorically closed, averting a major catastrophe.

Subsequent to the incident, an inquiry was launched to examine the actions of the flight crew. The investigation was spearheaded by Narayan Vedant, the head of the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau . The inquiry held significant importance as it was instigated, in part, by the unfortunate death of Alma Asthana, an elderly passenger who had placed her trust in Khanna's decision to divert to Trivandrum and had suffered a fatal heart attack en route to the hospital.

During the inquiry, Captain Khanna underwent a polygraph test. Vedant employed probing questions to unnerve Albuquerque, leading to her accidental revelation that Khanna had landed the plane with his eyes closed. Subsequently, in his testimony, Khanna astounded the inquiry panel by disclosing his photographic memory. He explained that he could vividly recollect the landing procedure and relied on his mental imagery based on past landings at the same runway during the ordeal. To demonstrate this extraordinary ability, he conducted a simulated flight with Vedant as his co-pilot. With his eyes covered, Khanna precisely replicated the actions he had taken during the night of the challenging landing.

As a result of the inquiry, Captain Vikrant Khanna received a three-month suspension. Nevertheless, his skill, ingenuity, and determination during the crisis earned him recognition and admiration within the aviation community.","['Drama', 'Thriller']","Inspired by true incidents, ""Runway 34"" revolves around Captain Vikrant Khanna played by Ajay Devgn, a flying prodigy, whose flight takes a mysterious course after take-off from an international destination.","Bellbottom,Traffic,Tees Maar Khan,Pathaan,Zanjeer,Sadak 2"

Kabir doesn't really want to be a part of their family business, he wants to be a pilot instead. Kamal and Neelam decide to celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary by inviting their family and friends for a fun trip on a big boat in the Mediterranean Sea.

In this story, there are two families called the Sood family and the Khanna family. Kamal and Neelam want their son Kabir to marry a girl named Noorie, who is from the Sood family. They want this because Noorie's father, Lalit, will invest in their business to help them avoid going bankrupt. But on the ship they are on, Kabir falls in love with a dancer named Farah Ali, who is from England and has Pakistani heritage. Meanwhile, Noorie falls in love with Rana, who is from the Khanna family and their families have a long-standing rivalry. Another person on the ship is Ayesha, who wants to get a divorce from her husband Manav. A childhood friend of Ayesha and Kabir, named Sunny, also enters the picture. Sunny and Ayesha used to be in love when they were younger, but Kamal paid for Sunny to go to university to separate them. Ayesha and Sunny still have feelings for each other, and unlike Manav, Sunny appreciates Ayesha's strong and independent personality and believes in equal rights for women.

Neelam sees Kamal being too friendly with another person and wonders why she didn't leave him even though he cheated before. Ayesha talks to Sunny about their break-up and unexpectedly kisses him, which surprises them both. Farah gets upset when she hears that Kabir is going to marry Noorie and leaves angrily. Kamal sees Noorie kissing Rana and finds out that Kabir and Noorie are not together, which makes him have a gas attack.

Kabir tells his family that he loves Farah and wants to do something different from the family business. He suggests that his sister Ayesha would be good at business. But when Kabir tries to convince his parents to let Ayesha get a divorce, they say no because they believe marriage should last forever. This makes Kabir very angry because he knows that his dad has cheated on his mom and that his mom has been unhappy for a long time. Kabir's dad asks his mom why she didn't leave him, and she says she couldn't because her family wouldn't take her back. Kabir's dad realizes he made a mistake and asks his mom to forgive him. He also sees how badly his son-in-law treats his daughter and tells them to leave. Finally, he agrees to let Ayesha get a divorce and says sorry to her.

Farah loses her job because she had a romantic relationship with someone on the ship. Kabir finds out about this after the ship has already left. He tells Sunny that Ayesha is getting a divorce, and then jumps off the ship to swim to shore, thinking his family will save him. Ayesha, Kamal, Neelam, and their friends get on a lifeboat to go after Kabir. Before they leave, Ayesha asks Sunny if he will wait for her, and he says he will wait forever. The family rescues Kabir and they all go towards shore to find Farah, while the ship's crew chases them. This is the first time the Mehra family is happy together.

13510660,Dhamaka,Action Crime Drama Thriller bridge minister caller studio time building terrorist call police live anchor broadcast people bomb,Action Crime Drama Thriller Reassigned radio air frustrated anchor danger opportunity receives threatening calls,"Arjun Pathak  was once a top news anchor, but gets demoted due to an unsavory incident. Pulled from prime-time TV news and recently divorced, he is now the jaded and bitter host of a current affairs radio program. One day during his morning show, Arjun receives a peculiar phone call threatening to blow up the Bandra-Worli Sea Link, a major bridge which is also just outside Arjun's studio building. At first, Arjun takes it as a joke or prank call and tells the terrorist to proceed. He watches in shock as the caller follows through on the threat and detonates explosives that cause the bridge to collapse, killing innocent people and trapping others.Realising this could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make his comeback as a newscaster, Arjun purposely doesn't call the police . Instead, he sets up a makeshift television studio from his radio station, and negotiates with his former boss , the profit- and ratings-obsessed news producer, Ankita Malaskar  who'll do anything to beat the other TV stations in their coverage of the bombing. Then Arjun strikes a dangerous deal with the terrorist to exclusively broadcast their phone conversations live , in real-time, as the whole nation watches.The newsroom erupts in chaos as Arjun, Ankita, the police, other broadcast providers and the government all exploit terrorism for their own agenda. The only exception is Soumya , Arjun's ex-wife, a reporter who volunteers to report from the site of the terrorist attack. Arjun is not happy that Ankita sent Soumya to the site for reporting.
As the live show progresses, Arjun gradually realizes how little control he has over the situation. The terrorist, who claims to be Raghubeer Mhata , a 50-something construction worker who lost three of his co-workers in a senseless industrial accident while fixing the bridge , says the families of the victims weren't compensated and demands a public apology from the minister Jeydev Patil  for the deaths of his colleagues. With several people remaining on the bridge as hostages, the terrorist threatens a second explosion. He also reveals to Arjun alone that he put a bomb in the anchor's earphone, and that if the minister doesn't apologize, the bomb will explode in his ear, live on air.Arjun promises to the caller that he will request the minister to come to their studio and give him an apology. Anti terrorism Officer Praveen Kamath  arrives at the studio and guides Arjun through the negotiations. Raghubeer had given a 10 mins warning to produce the minister. At the end of 10 mins, Praveen asks Arjun to tell Raghubeer that the Minister is coming in 5 mins.
The minister's deputy Subhash Mathur  arrives at the studio but refuses to apologize to the caller and asks him to negotiate. He also calls him a terrorist, which angers him. Arjun realizes that there is a bomb in Subhash's earpiece as well, and warns him discreetly. But the caller observes this through CCTV footage and immediately explodes the bomb in Subhash's earpiece, fatally injuring him.This leaves Arjun extremely scared and nervous. But Ankita orders him to keep going and tells him to not make any negotiations with the caller, as they are tracing the location of the call and would get hold of him soon. Ankita also says to tell Raghubeer that no minister is coming to deliver his apology. she knows that Raghubeer will do some stupidity and kill more hostages on the bridge. This way he will be the villain, cops will catch him, the minister wont have to say sorry and Arjun can claim that he helped catch Raghubeer.
The caller threatens to detonate more explosives at the bridge which could kill many people, including Arjun's wife Soumya. Arjun decides to go ahead with fulfilling the caller's demands and requests him to come to the studio where the minister would give him an apology.This angers Ankita, who leaks information of Arjun having accepted a bribe to cover up the news of the same incident of the construction workers losing their lives while repairing the bridge, which had led to him being demoted. It is also revealed that sometime earlier, Arjun had won the ""Journalist of the Year"" award, for a report which he had actually stolen from Soumya, which had led to their divorce. Ankita exposes this truth as well, which is broadcast by another news channel. Ankita blackmails Arjun by saying that she can still handle the situation and he can save his career and reputation, if he acts as per her orders.
Arjun continues to parley with Raghubeer and manages to convince him to let women and children off the bridge. Raghubeer agrees if Soumya agrees to stay behind as collateral. But before the rescue can be completed, the bridge collapses and Soumya apparently dies.The ATS traces the caller's location to a nearby building, but it's a trap, and the caller blows up the building, the impact of which causes the studio to also get nearly destroyed. Arjun is alive but gravely injured. He suddenly realizes that the caller is actually Raghubeer's son Anand, who wants to avenge the death of his father and coworkers, and that he has been calling from the same building. Arjun summons him to the studio, while everything is still being broadcast live. Anand arrives and reveals that he has planted an explosive in the same building and intends to blow it up. Just then, he is sniped down by the ATS from a nearby building, instantly killing him . Arjun finds out that the bridge has collapsed and many people have lost their lives, including Soumya.
On having found out that Arjun, instead of informing the police first, had decided to exclusively cover this news, to get back his position as the prime time news anchor, Ankita leaks this information. Another news channel broadcasts this news adding a false story of Arjun being actively involved in planning the attack, labeling him as an anti-national. Arjun, devastated, apologizes to his ex-wife and then himself detonates the explosive in the same building, causing it to collapse, killing him as well.","['Action', 'Crime', 'Drama', 'Thriller']","Reassigned from TV to radio, a frustrated anchor sees both danger and opportunity when he receives threatening calls on the air.","Modi Ji Ki Beti,Ghayal Once Again,Rush,Tere Bin Laden,Attack,Bellbottom"

They're joined by Mala along the way, who happens to be the long lost love of Bhupen and regrets having not fought for their love. A simple trek turns out to be a personal, emotional and spiritual journey as they battle their physical limitations and discover the true meaning of freedom.
'Uunchai' begins with a voiceover narration of Amitabh Bachchan telling the intent of the film in the very beginning. The film opens in the beautiful landscape of Nepal where we are introduced to all characters until each of their life with all its layers is gradually unfolded in the process of the film.

From here the narrative and landscape shifts to Delhi and the backstory of four aged-friends is revealed.Danny  passes away in his sleep, a day after his birthday party. That’s when we see a clearer picture of the bond he shared with his pals, Amitabh Bachchan , Anupam Kher  and Boman Irani .

Bhupen always wanted to go on a trek with his friends but just when he was envisioning a trip to Everest Base Camp  with them, he was gone. His friends then take the baton to take the plunge in their 70s and bury his ashes in the place that he forever thought of his own, Everest. And that is how the adventure begins.

The gradual unfurling of emotions, and each of characters' backstory is weaved very organically into the text, a commendable move in a film which has a lot of noise, particularly with this dominating force of a background score and with music: one song thrust upon another.","['Adventure', 'Drama']","Three friends take a trek to the Everest Base Camp.

Suddenly, a truck appears and runs over her. The men then burn her dead body.Next day, the newspapers carry reports that a young medical student, Archana, died by suicide.The cops insist that it was a suicide; the post-mortem report, by the college head Acharya , looks like a rushed job, getting her blood group wrong. Some college students, too, sound evasive. So does the owner of a local coaching institute, where Archana was a part-time teacher.Later we meet Dr. Shiv , arriving at his clinic and fighting with a constructor. Soon after a phone call, he rushes to the Ghaziabad police station. He fears that his daughter Archana, a medical student, has committed suicide. He notices that the police have not been fair on investigation and have declared it suicide already. Shiv and the audience are preoccupied by the same question: What is going on?


As a man with morals and emotions as a father, Dr. Shiv decides to seek the truth. He comes to know that the police and his daughter’s medical college are trying to cover up something by portraying this act as suicide. He takes the help of a corrupt money-minded policeman Yusuf  to uncover the truth. In a journey of finding the truth, they unveil dark secrets that bring danger to their own lives.Shiv finds an unlikely ally in a young cop, Yusuf . But he only listens to the sound of money. Shiv’s case provides him a new gateway: a way to earn some quick cash. It’s a curious collaboration that acquires symbolic meanings. Shiv, an honest, straightforward man, is the embodiment of old India.

Yusuf, brusque and violent and greedy, represents its new cannibalistic version. Which makes sense, because the scam at the centre of this story — of “management” seats in medical colleges, involving politicians, cops, coaching institutes, professors — emerges from the very insatiable hunger of the Indian middle-class, which can pay any price for their kids’ success. Some costs, however, are more unaffordable than others.

13491620,Unpaused,Drama Romance story uld lockdown girl Unpaused stories urban suffers problem attempt define mood couple lives,Drama Romance chances unique cinema love beginnings hope anthology brings creators featuring stories glimmer lockdown Set filmed times,"Unpaused, with five stories that attempt to define the mood of urban India during lockdown, suffers from that problem. Covid-19 is a first-generation menace that is in the past now, and science is struggling to fathom Covid-30 in the narrative, as a lonely and nervous ‘hypo’  goes on a virtual date with a spirited Covid warrior . The urge of companionship draws him to the girl, and he would personally love to meet her. But there is always the fear of infection to psyche him out. Raj and DK’s storytelling reveals relish and irreverence despite the uncomfortable future the storyline imagines.

The second story, Nikkhil Advani’s The Apartment, tries mixing the malaise outside with one that threatens to tear apart the protagonist from within. The story is about a couple , whose lives are irreparably damaged when he is charged with multiple MeToo allegations. He denies, she is almost driven to suicide. When she presses, he retorts saying she should have stopped him. There is no specific reason why this story should have been set during lockdown and, as such, there is hardly any factor that might hold your attention through the runtime.

Tannishtha Chatterjee directs Rat-a-Tat, about a young girl  and her grumpy elderly neighbour . The neighbour is hostile towards the girl to begin with, but they strike a bond somewhere in their quest for purpose in life and hope. Unfolding at a languid pace, the film captures the essence of human relationship making interesting use of music.

Avinash Arun Dhaware’s story that follows vaguely resonates the spirit of Bong Joon-ho’s Oscar-winning gem, Parasite. Titled Vishaanu, the story casts Abhishek Banerjee and Geetika Vidya Ohlyan as a migrant couple in Mumbai who, along with their boy, find luxurious haven in a sample flat of half-constructed highrise amid lockdown. The film uses TikTok in a quirky way to carry the story forward — in the time of the Wuhan-origin virus, it is ironic that the banned Chinese app should play havoc in the lives of the protagonists.

the final story, Chand Mubarak, which traces an unlikely bond between a posh aging loner named Uma  and an autorickshaw driver Rafique , in whom she sees her late brother. The idea lacks originality but Mehra makes up for that drawback by getting the emotional core of the tale right.

5165344,Rustom,Crime Drama Thriller ship found named lot wanted important papers people called friend house time recording,Crime Drama Thriller affair naval officer returns home find wife unfolds intention surrenders murdering lover case starts reveal hidden,"Once upon a time in 1959, there was a man named Officer Rustom Pavri who was married to Cynthia. They were happy together, but then Rustom found out that Cynthia was having a secret relationship with his friend Vikram. Rustom came back from his job on a ship earlier than expected and found love letters from Vikram to Cynthia. He saw them together and got upset. When Cynthia came home, Rustom showed her the letters, but he left before she could explain. Rustom was really angry and went to get a gun from his ship. He called a important person in the government named Defence Secretary Bakshi and then went to find Vikram. Rustom went to Vikram's office and then his house. When Rustom went into Vikram's bedroom, the servant heard gunshots and found Vikram dead with three bullets in his chest. Rustom was walking away with the gun. He immediately gave himself up to the police and a detective named Inspector Lobo started to investigate the case.

Vikram's sister, Preeti, went to a person called Lakshman to try and make sure that Rustom gets in a lot of trouble. But Rustom didn't want anyone's help and decided to fight his case by himself. He also wanted to be kept in custody by the police. Rustom's boss in the navy, Rear Admiral Prashant, sent two bad guys to Rustom's house to look for some papers, but they couldn't find anything. A lady named Cynthia, who was scared, went to the jail to tell Rustom what happened. Rustom finally listened to Cynthia's story about how she was sad and alone when Rustom went away for a long time. Cynthia's friend Vikram used her feelings of loneliness to his advantage and she fell for him. But on the day Vikram was killed, Cynthia had already broken up with him because she wanted to stay married. Vikram hit Cynthia and hurt her before she left his house.

Rustom told Cynthia to scare Kamath by asking him for a lot of money in exchange for important papers he needed. But then, when Rustom went to court, he said he didn't do anything wrong, even though it surprised the judge. So, they had a trial with a group of people called a jury. After the trial, the jury said Rustom was not guilty because he hurt Vikram to protect himself. Later, they found out that Lobo was in another city and talked to Bakshi to get a recording of a phone call that Rustom made. When they played the recording in court, it made a lot of people think Rustom was guilty. The jury had to think about everything and decide what they believed.

One day, Rustom tells his friend Lobo something important. He was sent to London a long time ago to check out a big ship that the Navy wanted to buy. But when he looked at the ship, he saw that it was damaged and needed to be fixed before it could be used. Vikram and Kamath wanted the ship to be bought by India, so they tried to bribe Rustom to say it was safe. Rustom didn't like this and told Bakshi about it. But even Bakshi tried to bribe Rustom. Vikram was angry at Rustom, so he dated Cynthia to make Rustom jealous. Rustom got so mad that he shot and killed Vikram. Bakshi sent Kamath to get some important papers that Rustom said he had. Rustom also said there was a recording of a phone call, but Bakshi only gave Lobo half of it to hide his own bad actions. Rustom says he didn't actually have any papers to prove the ship was damaged. He didn't want the Navy to have a bad reputation.

The next day, Rustom is told by the judge and the people who decide if he is guilty or not that he did not do anything wrong. Rustom and Cynthia leave the courtroom feeling proud. The movie ends with Rustom and Cynthia going on a trip after getting a lot of money from Bakshi, who was involved in a plan to cheat people. Rustom found out that the thing he bought was in good condition when he read about it in the newspaper, which made him happy.","['Crime', 'Drama', 'Thriller']","A naval officer returns home to find out about his wife's affair.

In his late 30s, he is only interested in 'scoring' one night stands while his friends are all married with kids. The movie opens with one such scene where his friends tell him to get married as he is too old to screw around. In turn, Mandar explains his philosophy about sex as a purely physical act, somewhat akin to the satisfaction of the 'perfect' bowel movement. 'Its a physical need' he philosophies, whereas love is a different ball game and isn't necessary for sex.The narration now moves back several years to Mandar's early teenage years. The year is 1989, Mandar along with his cousin Dilip   visits his village in Maharashtra where their cousin Kshitij  is already waiting for them . 15-year-old Kshitij is studying in a military school  and is mature beyond his years in his views and aspects about marriage, love and sex.

One day, the person in charge of Pranav's school tells everyone that he did something really bad. He took videos from another person's phone and showed them to other kids, and he also pretended to be his dad by signing papers. Pranav gets in trouble and has to stay home from school. This causes a big problem at home. Sulu's sisters blame her and say that she doesn't take care of Pranav because she has a job and isn't very educated. They want her to quit her job, but Sulu stands up for herself and says no. Later, Sulu gets a call that Pranav is missing. Sulu and Ashok find a note from Pranav saying he feels bad for what he did and he's sad that his mom had to quit her job because of him. Pranav asks his dad to support his mom and her work. Ashok and Sulu make up and look for their son together.

The police found Pranav and brought him back home. Sulu decided to quit the show because it was causing problems at her house.

The place turns out to be Kashyap's house, and another call confirms that Sonam has been held in his DVD room. When they get there, not only is Sonam gone, but Kashyap's parents have also been kidnapped. After a struggle between the trio, Kashyap reveals the original site he had planned and they rush to it as time runs out. A mysterious second cameraman shows up, but they don't find any of the kidnapped.

10083640,Bhoot Police,Comedy Horror kichk bro ndi exorcism book vill nto work girl finds med,Comedy Horror brothers village job hunt eradicate ghosts money assigned project remote,"Two brothers, Vibhooti and Chiraunji run an exorcist business and together travel all over the country. They are famous known as Ullat Baba and sons, though know nothing about supernatural beings and exorcism and thrive only on the superstitions of people.

The movie starts with them arriving in a village in Rajasthan to perform an exorcism on a young girl who was being possessed by her late grandfather. However, Vibhooti soon realizes that the girl was faking the possession to which she admits. Turns out, her parents were forcing her to get married while she wanted to continue her studies. The brothers agree to help her and although Chiraunji is against the illicit ways his brother uses, the duo performs a fake exorcism.

Later, the brothers arrive at a Tantric fair in search of new cases. When Vibhooti is busy with one of the clients, Chiraunji leaves the camp with their father's book to concentrate on deciphering it. However, the script used in the book is an ancient language that no one knows how to read. Defeated and tired, Chiraunji asks his father to show him a sign and help him, who subtly does so by making the book roll down the hill and stop at the feet of a girl named Maya .While Chiraunji takes it from her, he accidentally finds the key to reading the ancient book and runs off to inform his brother. Vibhooti is disinterested at first and they have a comical spat when suddenly Vibhooti sees Police Inspector, Chedilal looking for them. Vibhooti then tells Chiraunji to pack all the stuff and runs to the van & tries to distract Chedilal so that both him and his younger brother can escape. Meanwhile, Chiraunji finds Maya with another Baba  under the disguise of Ullat baba. Upset and at the same time frustrated because of being a fraudster, he tells Maya the truth about them being the original Ullat Baba and sons. In a matter of a few minutes, Vibhooti shows up and the three head for Dharamshala.

Maya tells them how 27 years ago their father, the infamous Ullat Baba, helped her father by banishing a paranormal entity known as ""kichkandi"" from their tea estate in Dharamshala. Now the same Kichkandi is back and the workers are scared to work at the factory after nightfall. The van arrives in the village and everyone, except for Maya's sister Kanika, warmly welcomes the duo. While Chiraunji interviews the village folk, who each have different accounts of being haunted by the Kichkandi, Vibhooti entertains a little girl named Teetli. Maya sees a photo of Ullat Baba and sees one person who's still around, a man named Santo.

The brothers visit Santo, who lives in a Monastery. Santo recalls how 27 years ago, his wife was possessed by the Kichkandi, killing two people, and permanently blinding Santo. Ullat Baba came, and performed an exorcism in the forest, trapping the spirit of the Kichkandi in a bone in a jar, and securing it in a burned tree. However, Santo's wife died. The brothers go to the forest and find the same jar. Vibhooti, who is a skeptic of the supernatural, breaks open the jar and leaves the bone in the forest. Maya's dog, Shunko comes with the bone in the mouth to Maya's bedroom and as a result, Maya gets possessed. Vibhooti, still skeptical, finds that the manager was pretending to be the original ghost to scare off the tea villagers so Kanika can convince her sister into selling off their estate. Vibhooti agrees to perform a fake exorcism in exchange for money. During the fake exorcism, Vibhooti spikes Chiaruanji's drink without his knowledge to create a dramatic scenario for the villagers to believe. Chiraunji learns of this and the two brothers get into an altercation and decide to go their separate ways.

Vibhooti encounters Teetli again and while running away from Chedi, he realizes that Teetli is indeed a ghost and starts to believe in ghosts himself. Kichkandi who now possesses Maya attacks Chiraunji and Chiraunji accidentally transfers the spirit from Maya's to Vibhooti's body when he meant to transfer it to himself. Chiraunji, with the help of his father's knowledge, sees that Kichkandi is actually Teetli's mother and they were both killed by the British owners of the land, Kichkandi was burnt alive while Titli was shot when she was waiting for her mother. Kichkandi is looking for her daughter. The brother and the rest of the gang duo help Titli and Kichkandi reunite and the spirits fade away into the sky. Maya and Kanika reaffirm their sisterly bond. The screen cuts to black and the song ""Aayi Aayi Bhoot Police"" plays. Then we see Chedilal on phone with an unknown person, who asks him if the Bhoot Police is ready to take a case involving werewolves and vampires.

4232066,Once Again,Drama Romance film ghost nce ughter rel tionship rest son lso underst lly Imti people runs city,Drama Romance conversations person chance phone call leads widowed restaurant owner lonely film actor plan finally meet,"Amar is an ageing film star. A famous and wealthy man, he lives alone in Mumbai, a city of 15 million souls, the city of dreams. Tara, a widow, runs a small restaurant with the help of her son, who delivers Amar's meals. Tara has never seen Amar - except on the big screen. What began by pure chance a year ago has now turned into a ritual: for hours on end they talk to each other on the phone. Until one day, when Amar sets out to meet Tara in the flesh. Once Again is a story of two middle-aged people Tara  and Amar  who fall in love once again. Tara is a businesswoman who runs a restaurant and also supplies tiffins to people. Amar, a famous actor, is one of her clients. Tara and Amar develop a relationship over food and notes they exchange with the tiffins. Tara is a widow who lost her husband years ago and has two children—a son and a daughter. Amar is a divorced man and has a daughter. After the news of their relationship comes out, they face some challenges in their relationship with each other and with their children. 

In the opening lines of the film, Amar says that Mumbai is a strange city. The sea seems so close, yet so far. Tara said she was afraid of the sea.
Amar is working in a film in which he is playing the character of a ghost. It is as if elements of this ghost's story mirror those of real-life Amar's. When Tara and Amar go on a drive, he tells her that while playing the role of a ghost, he has turned into one himself. At another point, Tara thinks that she saw someone watching her, her daughter replies that it might be a ghost. During a filmmaking session, Amar says that he is not happy with his own dance performance. He feels that the ghost is not dancing freely and looks more like a puppet. He had seen a group of men dancing on the road during a religious procession and wants to dance like them. The actress in his film tells him that he does not understand her role. The filmmaker adds that a ghost will turn into a human only after he falls in love and it is the woman who brings about the ghost's transformation. During the same scene, Tara comes to visit Amar and he introduces her to his friends as someone who makes food for him. He insults her by reducing her role to that of someone whose only purpose in his life is making food for him. Like Amar does not understand the character of the woman in his film, he does not understand the importance of Tara in his real life. At an early point, Tara and Amar had a conversation where he says, ""Khud ko hi dhoond ke kisi ko paya ka sakta hai."" Only when you find yourself, you can find someone else. Tara replies, ""Shayad kisi aur ko paakar khud ko dhoonda ja sakta hai."" Maybe one can also oneself by loving someone else. It is this learning that Amar has to realize both in his film and in his life and then only he can transform himself from a ghost to a human. When he finally understands this, Amar dances uninhibitedly with the same boys he had seen earlier during a religious celebration and turns into a human. He realizes his folly and goes to apologize to Tara. He says that he does not want to hide his own self anymore. He has understood what Tara is to him. In this sense, Amar's character is the middle-aged version of the lost protagonists created in the films of Imtiaz Ali and Ranbir Kapoor. In what is a curious coincidence, the woman who helps Amar find himself here is also named Tara . 


After the death of her husband, Tara gave up everything she liked. She never married again. She runs the restaurant on her own. She never danced again. She tells her daughter that many a time, she thought of running away but did not do so for the sake of her children. Tara suppressed all her desires for all these years. Middle-aged people also have desires but society believes in suppressing them. Her son's mother-in-law sarcastically remarks that for them, the happiness of their kids is more important than their own. Tara's son did not like her mother's relationship with Amar.

13793230,Jaadugar,Comedy Drama Fantasy Romance Sport team football local Neemuch win love tournament game magic player finds,Comedy Drama Fantasy Romance Sport loves small-time magician win local football tournament order marry girl,"Meenu  is a small-town  magician who doesn't like football & sucks at it. His father was a local football champion , who died while on his way to a game. He wanted Meenu to become a footballer, but Meenu was very bad at it and could not be trained for the same. Since then, his uncle Pradeep  wants the team to win the medal that Meenu's father couldn't. Pradeep coaches a local football team that consistently performs badly at the local football tournament. The team has a ragtag group of players like Lalli  , Ramswaroop  , Dipa  , goalie Hemant . Avinash  is the local MLA and sponsor of the local league.But Meenu has a different view of things. He blames football for his father's death and wants nothing to do with it. That makes him turn to magic as his profession, and he is good at it. His girlfriend, Ichha , breaks up with him because she believes that while Meenu can fall in love, he can never be responsible . Months pass, and Meenu finds love again, with Disha .
Disha is new to town and Meenu sees her at a local wedding, where he is performing magic show. Meenu finds that she is a bone doctor and approaches her as a patient with back pain, but it turns out that she is an eye doctor. Disha finds out that he is bluffing and throws him out of her office.
Later that night Disha is walking to an address late at night and is lost. She runs into Meenu, who guides her to the right address.Both of them slowly start falling in love. One day, when Meenu asks her to marry him, she tells him that she is a divorcee. Her marriage had caused a rift between her and her parents, as she had married against their wishes. After her divorce, when she went back home, she found that her mother had passed away, but she had not known because she had cut all contact with her family. So now she has decided to marry whoever her father magician Chhabra  chooses for her. When Meenu questions her as to her choice, she justifies it by saying that it is her ""choice"" to heed her father.
Meanwhile Pradeep's team ""Adarsh Nagar Panthers"" is about to be disqualified from the league as the team is hopeless. Pradeep begs to Avinash that he wants to fulfill his brothers dream. He was supposed to travel for that fateful match, when he got sick and his brother traveled instead and died. Avniash agrees on the condition that Pradeep assembles 11 players and a sub in 6 weeks time. Pradeep wants Meenu to play, but Meenu brutally insults Pradeep saying that he was responsible for his father's death and is not worthy to win the tournament. Pradeep is heartbroken and tries to commit suicide. This brings the team together. The team decides to register itself, but on the day Meenu is called by Disha to meet her dad.
Of course, Meenu goes to ask for her hand in marriage and finds that her father is his old magic teacher. He places a condition in front of Jeetu that to marry his daughter, he must execute two miracles. The first one is that his football team must reach the finals of the tournament. The second one will be revealed later.
Meanwhile the team registers with Riju, instead of Meenu. Rishu is a garbage collector from a different neighborhood. Pradeep also changes to name to Adarsh Nagar Sikandars.Meenu, who has always hated football, must now make the game his own to win his lady love. But the team is just a group of neighbors, who are only together because of their love for Meenu's uncle. They have only one good player- Riju , and he doesn't even belong to their neighborhood. They have fraudulently said he is, for the sake of having at least one winning chance. Pradeep refuses to have Meenu in the team as Meenu has always abandoned them. In the first match, Meenu slyly injures the most useless player of the team and this forces Pradeep to induct Meenu into the team.
But with Meenu now in their team, he encourages them all the time and uses his mind games and magic tricks to get them ahead in the game. He guilt trips Disha into joining the team as its physician to keep everyone fit and fine. She cures Hemant of his left side deficiency. Dipa moves to midfield to create opportunities for Riju.
Finally, the team starts climbing up the rankings and ultimately reaches the finals. So yes, Meenu has executed the first miracle. Now it's time to learn the second one. The revelation changes things for him at his magic show ; it happens right before the match.Meenu puts on a play about Disha's story, sparking a reconciliation between her and her father. Meenu's teacher gives him his second condition now. He tells him that he must make sure that his team loses the match the next day. His reasoning is that his ex-son-in-law divorced his daughter because he chose his family. He wants to see if Meenu can choose his daughter over his family. Meenu, though feeling guilty, decides to do so. Meenu reveals to Avinash that Riju is not from their neighborhood. Riju's shack is demolished. But unknown to Meenu, his friend has heard everything, and he tells Disha. Disha tells Meenu to just do the right thing.At the match, Meenu leaves no effort in making his team lose. They are up against the City Giants, who have 2 champion forwards and a national goalie, who has not conceded a single goal this entire season.
But when it is his turn to take the penalty kick, Meenu's friend Lali spills the beans to his team. However, to Meenu's surprise, the team stood by him. They tell him that they are ready to lose the game as it could possibly mean more than his life and marriage. This was shockingly practical and so heart-touching. Maybe Meenu felt the same, because he changed his decision to make his team lose and scored a point with his kick. He and his team are now ready to play, but unfortunately, they end up losing, as their game was just not strong enough. However, they have won everyone's hearts as the underdogs.When the winning team is taking the trophy, one of the Sikandar team members hilariously gets into a tussle with them and challenges them to a fight off the field. Luckily, that does not happen, and he is dragged away. Disha's father agrees to their marriage, and all is well in paradise. But it gets better. Rishu, their star player, makes it to the national team, and the Sikandars are called back to play for the upcoming tournament, signifying that there is still scope to win the trophy.","['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Romance', 'Sport']","Magic Meenu, a small-time magician in Neemuch, M.P., has to win a local football tournament in order to marry the girl he loves.","Judaa Hoke Bhi,Tanu Weds Manu,Khamoshiyan,Tanu Weds Manu Returns,Aiyyaa,Khoobsurat"
13801462,Gandhi Godse Ek Yudh,Drama History end ideologies violence hatred played division movie starts heartbreaking scenes wound needed worsen weapons,Drama History survives meets prison fictional world attack conversation leads fiery debate,"The movie starts with heartbreaking scenes about the division of India. Capturing the triggering image of mass migration perfectly. Hindus, Sikhs, and Muslims are killed in an attempt to elope to their homelands, named Hindustan and Pakistan, respectively. At the PM's office, politicians can be seen in a state of worry, as they are taken aback by the violence prevailing in India and the neighbouring country. 

'Mahatma Gandhi was the one who wanted this partition', this misguided ideology, triggers Nathuram Godse  and his underlying hatred for Mahatma arises with each passing frame, provoking him to plan his assassination. But Gandhi  survives the attacks at Birla House, and the murderer and the victim come face-to-face, giving birth to an imaginary war of ideologies.

The two end up in the same place; no weapons are needed, but their words for each other have enough sharpness that can either heal or worsen the wound. Nathuram is portrayed as a kattar hindu desh bhakt who feels that ahinsa , or violence, is the need of the hour. We can also smell his hatred towards the Muslims in the film; however, Gandhi, on the other hand, is a torchbearer of non-violence and follows certain ideologies that, unsurprisingly, end up hurting the people around him.

Their presence is facilitated by two warm-hearted locals, Jomin and Panda, who take it upon themselves to show the city-slickers around this charming corner of the world.

Their adventures take a surprising turn one fateful night when, while exploring the dense forest, Bhaskar encounters a menacing wolf. In a harrowing encounter, he falls victim to a wolf bite, a wound that leaves a significant mark on his rear end. Dr. Anika, the local veterinarian, emerges as Bhaskar's savior, tending to his wounds and potentially preventing a dire fate.

In the following days, Bhaskar undergoes a remarkable transformation, grappling with heightened senses of smell and hearing. To his astonishment, he discovers an inexplicable ability to communicate with animals. These newfound abilities gradually unravel the mysteries lurking within the forest.

Meanwhile, the road-building project is met with strong opposition from the locals and tribal communities. Their fierce determination to preserve the forest and the environment culminates in the deaths of two individuals involved in the project, bearing the unmistakable bite marks of an animal. Panda boldly proclaims that the killings are the work of a supernatural being, the dreaded ""Yapum"" or werewolf.

However, as the layers of the story are peeled back, a startling revelation emerges—Bhaskar is the true perpetrator of the crimes. The wolf's bite has cursed him, transforming him into a werewolf every night against his will, leaving him devoid of control over his own actions.

Dismayed by Bhaskar's uncontrollable affliction, Bhaskar and Jana decide to confine him to a remote location during the perilous nights to ensure the safety of those around him.

In addition to his professional life, Vikram finds himself deeply in love with Neha Mehta, a forensic expert who happens to be his colleague.

Rohit, another close friend and colleague of Vikram, often joins him in their professional endeavors. However, Vikram's interactions with Akshay, another officer, are less than harmonious, as they frequently clash over boundaries and methods. Vikram is a complex character who occasionally grapples with post-traumatic stress disorder  due to past experiences but adamantly refuses to take any medication, believing it may impair his remarkable abilities.

The narrative takes an intriguing turn as Preeti, a young woman, encounters a car malfunction while driving along a highway. Her unexpected predicament leads her to cross paths with Officer Ibrahim Sheikh, who stops to assist her. When Preeti realizes she left her phone at home, she contacts her father for help. However, when her father arrives to pick her up, he discovers that she has mysteriously vanished. A bewildered Ibrahim informs Preeti's parents, inadvertently insulting them in the process.

In light of Preeti's inexplicable disappearance, Ajit, a good friend of her parents, makes the difficult decision to suspend Ibrahim due to his unprofessional conduct and the skepticism surrounding the case. Vikram becomes privy to the situation and, despite being on a six-month break to address his PTSD episodes, decides to intervene.

After two months of resuming his investigation, Vikram receives distressing news about Neha's disappearance. His determination to uncover the truth prompts him to approach Ajit for the case file regarding Neha's vanishing act. However, Ajit reveals that Akshay is overseeing the case and refuses to share the file.

Undeterred, Vikram turns to Saxena, one of Neha's colleagues, to gather information about her cases from the past two months. Vikram and Rohit's astute investigative skills lead them to draw connections between the cases of Preeti and Neha. They begin to suspect that a common thread and perhaps the same perpetrator may be involved in both disappearances.

With a renewed sense of purpose, Vikram takes charge of Preeti's case, determined to bring clarity to both troubling situations. He meticulously interviews the individuals who interacted with Preeti on the night of her disappearance, striving to piece together the puzzle.

During their inquiries, Vikram and Rohit learn of Preeti's unusual background, discovering that she once resided with her foster parents, Ajay and Sandya, after the tragic loss of her biological parents in a plane crash. A visit to her neighbor, Sheela, provides additional insight into Preeti's life.

Vikram and Rohit's collective deduction eventually points them in the direction of Sheela, who is suspected of being the kidnapper. A pivotal discovery comes when they identify Sheela's distinctive blue car and come across a note that appears to disclose Preeti's whereabouts.

As the investigation progresses, Ibrahim stumbles upon the blue car and contradicts the initial suspicion against Sheela. This twist forces Vikram and his team to reconsider the direction of their investigation. Their attention shifts, and Vikram discovers disturbing evidence that challenges their previous assumptions. He discerns that the blue car and note are part of a forged trail designed to divert attention.

Vikram turns his attention to Ajay, as he begins to suspect him, given Ajay's relationship with Preeti and the possible motive behind her disappearance. While Vikram, Rohit, and their team relentlessly search for evidence, a new and unexpected lead emerges.

A mysterious woman named Eesha contacts Vikram, seeking help due to her ongoing stalking ordeal. She provides harrowing details of a stalker who follows her in a car, insisting that they need to talk. Fearing for her safety, Eesha reaches out to Vikram for assistance, opening up a new avenue for investigation.

Vikram delves into the case further, using toll booth security cameras to gather information and determine the identity of the person who kidnapped Preeti. Their investigation leads them to Fahad, a man they believe to be the perpetrator. Despite Fahad's capture, he remains tight-lipped about his involvement.

In a tragic turn of events, Vikram and his team confront Fahad, but their confrontation takes a devastating twist as Fahad fatally shoots Ibrahim. Vikram and Akshay apprehend Fahad, determined to uncover the truth behind his actions.

As Fahad is interrogated, the pieces of the puzzle slowly come together. Vikram uncovers a sinister connection to the case—Rohit's involvement and his own home. Before Vikram can further investigate, Rohit opens fire, leading to a deadly encounter where Vikram ultimately takes Rohit's life.

While Vikram attempts to resolve the case and lay Preeti to rest, Akshay heads upstairs to find Neha, unaware of the shocking revelations yet to unfold. The truths surrounding Preeti's disappearance and the implications of Rohit's involvement are gradually revealed.

The investigation takes an unexpected turn as Vikram unearths the unidentified DNA on Preeti's body, which ultimately leads to a startling revelation—Rohit was responsible for Preeti's death. Rohit's motive for orchestrating Preeti's abduction and his own death at the hands of Vikram unveil a disturbing and intricate tale of obsession and tragedy.

Despite their success in solving Preeti's case, the somber reality remains. Vikram and his team bid farewell to their fallen comrades, Ibrahim and Rohit, as they honor their memory in a poignant funeral service.

8504014,Good Newwz,Comedy Drama Deepu CEO pregn child sperm tion lly couple couples nce ncy meet bond fter list,Comedy Drama babies surname pursue in-vitro fertilization wait upcoming Trouble couples couple ensues find sperms mixed,"Varun Batra is the CEO of a Volkswagen showroom in Mumbai and his wife, Deepti ""Deepu"" Batra, is a celebrity journalist. The two are a happily married couple going on seven years, but struggle to conceive a baby. Varun's sister Richa suggests the couple meet reputed fertility specialist Dr. Anand Joshi, who suggests they do in vitro fertilisation , a fertility technique that will enhance their chances. They agree, Varun submits sperm samples, and Dr. Joshi seemingly places the embryo created in his lab by Varun's sperm in Deepti's uterus.

12 days later, Varun and Deepti are hastily summoned by Dr. Anand's wife, Dr. Sandhya Joshi. Here, the two run into another homonymous couple, Honey Batra and Monika ""Moni"" Batra, who have taken up IVF as well. Anand guiltily reveals that a sperm mix-up has occurred: Varun's sperm have been mixed with Monika's eggs, and Honey's sperm with Deepti's eggs. Shocked beyond belief, both couples attack the two doctors. The doctors suggest that the couples go for a minor procedure so there is no chance of pregnancy. Varun later learns from Honey that Monika is pregnant with Varun's child, and Deepti is pregnant with Honey's child, but his rudeness causes Honey to fear the loss of his own child as Deepti has also gotten pregnant. He vows to prevent an abortion on Deepti's part, and he and Monika rent out a flat just above Varun's and Deepti's, much to the couple's shock.

Varun and Deepti initially project frustration against Honey and Monika during the first six months of pregnancy for interfering in their lives. However, during a routine check-up in the seventh month of pregnancy, Sandhya advises Deepti to try talking to Monika, who is probably going through as much as she is emotionally distressed. Realizing that she needs to try to understand the situation, Deepti asks Monika out for a street food treat, during which they start getting to know each other. Deepti learns that Monika had suffered two miscarriages, making her sympathise, and the women bond. However, Varun still nurses a negative attitude, especially since Deepti is not carrying his child. She takes a stand in Honey's and Monika's favour for the first time, angrily telling Varun that he never cared to understand anything that happened post the mishap.

Varun, with Deepti's confrontation still fresh in his mind, makes an attempt to bond with Honey when they meet at a bar, and they almost strike a chord with each other, until Honey expresses concern over Deepti's work commitments, which he thinks will have a negative impact on the child. Varun, incensed, snubs Honey in a possessive manner, and all else fails. An argument between the two escalates until Varun storms out and Honey is arrested by the cops after the manager drops a call.

That night, amidst heavy rains, Monika knocks on Deepti's door in desperation: she has gone into premature labour and Honey is nowhere to be found. Varun hurriedly drives Monika to the hospital and she gives birth to Varun's child. However, the newborn is shifted to a critical unit in grave condition, having been born with a respiratory defect, accelerated by Monika's history of miscarriages, with little chance of survival. As it dawns on him that the baby is in fact his, Varun begins crying and hugs Honey when he arrives after being let off with a warning. Even as Honey and Monika reunite, he goes home and breaks down in Deepti's arms, apologising for his past insensitivity.

For a few weeks, both couples pray for the baby's recovery and Monika remains in the hospital as Deepti tends to her. The baby finally recovers and after 2 months, Deepti too has a successful delivery. Varun, now a changed man, invites Honey and Monika to meet the baby. Both couples finally bond and accept each other, holding each other's babies in their arms.","['Comedy', 'Drama']",Two couples with the same surname pursue in-vitro fertilization and wait for their upcoming babies.

3001638,Mary Kom,Action Biography Drama Sport boxing gym coach glove sport training young daughter finds remains starts rice farmer,Action Biography Drama Sport boxer dream chronicle life hardships audaciously accomplishing ultimate,"A young Mangte Chungeijang Kom, daughter of a rice farmer from Imphal, finds a boxing glove in the remains of an air crash in 1991 in Kangathei. Kom is fascinated by the glove and grows up taking a keen interest in boxing, despite her father's disapproval. During an early fight, she chases a boy and ends up in a boxing gym. After realising that the coach of the gym, Narjit Singh, was also the coach of the Asian champion Dingko Singh, Kom tells him about her boxing aspirations. He asks her to visit the gym for the next thirty days and says that he will only teach her if she is deserving enough. She starts visiting the gym, informing her mother but not her father. Days pass, but her coach does not enquire about her. Due to Kom's dedication and stubbornness, Singh starts training her. Later, he suggests changing her name to Mary Kom.

Kom challenges a local wrestler for money, in order to get a household cow back, which the family had to sell off because of their financial troubles. This is where she meets the footballer Onler Kom. After winning the state-level championship, her father confronts her for keeping her involvement in the sport from him. When her father asks her to choose between him and boxing, she reluctantly chooses the sport. After watching her victorious 2002 Women's World Amateur Boxing Championships match on television, her father reconciles with Kom, and apologises to her for not understanding her passion for the sport. Meanwhile, Onler proposes to her and agrees never to ask her to quit boxing. After she wins the 2006 Women's World Amateur Boxing Championships, Kom agrees to marry him, much to her coach's dissatisfaction. After the marriage, Kom gets pregnant and gives up her career to look after her family.

Kom gives birth to twins and applies for a government job. However, she refuses the position of a police constable, feeling that as a world-champion boxer, she deserves better. It devastates her to learn that people no longer recognise her. Onler encourages her to restart her boxing training. She joins the gym again, leaving her husband to look after the twins at home. Her coach is still upset about her decision to marry, but Kom makes a comeback in the National Boxing Championship. Despite performing better than her opponent, she loses the match due to the apparent partiality of the judges. Kom throws a chair in anger towards them, resulting in a ban. She later writes an apology letter, and the official accepts it, but only after insulting her.

Kom then convinces Narjit Singh to train her, as she thinks that he is the one who can get the best out of her. After completing her training, she participates in the 2008 AIBA Women's World Boxing Championships and reaches the finals. Meanwhile, Onler informs her about one of her children having ventricular septal defect. In the subsequent fight, Kom fails to defend herself. After a knockout punch from her opponent, Kom hallucinates about her husband and children in the audience. She regains her strength and fights back, winning the championship. On the podium, while accepting the medal, she learns that her son's surgery was successful. Later, she is given the nickname ""Magnificent Mary"", with the Indian flag waving and the Indian national anthem playing in the background.","['Action', 'Biography', 'Drama', 'Sport']","A chronicle of the life of Indian boxer Mary Kom, who went through several hardships before audaciously accomplishing her ultimate dream.","Toofaan,Dangal,Lakshmi,Plan A Plan B,Babli Bouncer,Ujda Chaman"

5743656,Phobia,Drama Mystery Thriller severed apartment earlier finger artist highly talented call visions issues freezer paranoid diary parents,Drama Mystery Thriller woman traumatized events finds home agoraphobic young past trapped terrorized,"Mehak Deo  is a highly talented artist. An unfortunate traumatic event - being molested by a taxi driver – causes her to develop extreme Agoraphobia, a condition in which the individual is paranoid about being in public places and dislikes socializing with large groups of unknown people. Mehak's sister Anusha , initially supportive, becomes exhausted with her eccentric behavior, especially when it starts impacting her own 5-year-old son.

Shaan , a close friend, takes Mehak to an empty apartment, on the assumption that living alone for a while might benefit her. At the new apartment, Mehak befriends Nikki , a college-going girl who lives in the neighbourhood. Her other neighbour Manu  is working on anger management issues and is part of a community laughter club.

Manu is devastated because his girlfriend, Jiah Khurana , has left him. Jiah had earlier lived in Mehak's new apartment and suddenly disappeared without a trace; without paying rent and without claiming her advance deposit back leaving behind most of her belongings. Mehak comes across Jiah's diary chronicling her tempestuous and abusive relationship with Manu due to his temper issues. Mehak concludes from the diary that Manu killed Jiah, convinced by Jiah's sudden departure, Manu's seemingly questionable behaviour and a series of vivid visions she has of what seems to be Jiah's death like a severed finger in her freezer, a red knife on her bathroom floor , a male intruder in her bedroom and a wounded woman in her bathtub. This prompts her to call Jiah's parents to convey her suspicions, though Shaan is sceptical.

Jiah suddenly arrives and confronts them regarding Mehak's call to Jiah's parents. Jiah then reconciles with a reformed Manu, confirming that Mehak was mistaken leaving Mehak questioning her very reality.

When Shaan confesses that he has always loved her and tries to kiss her, she spurns him and berates him furiously, accusing him of exploiting her weakened state of mind. During the resulting confrontation between them, since the exact sequence of events occurs just like her visions, Mehak realizes that they were premonitions of her future. She then concludes that she's the one who's going to be killed by Shaan . In a paranoid delusional panic she attacks him with a knife. Shaan's attempts to calm her result in her finger getting severed accidentally. Shaan calls for an ambulance after preserving her severed digit in her freezer.

She locks up Shaan in her bedroom and exits her building in a daze finally having overcome her fear. In the climactic scene, her vision once again coincides with reality, as we see a painting she created earlier, showing hands reaching out to her, mirrors the situation in which she is injured and goes out in the open for help, overcoming her condition.

1948150,Singham,Action Crime Drama police Prakash Raj officers bail Inspector officer charge station God villagers,Action Crime Drama humiliated officer gangster honest police transferred town controlled weak good power bring made foolish,"Inspector Rakesh Kadam  is an honest police officer who ends up committing suicide due to the false accusations of corruption levelled against him by Jaikant Shikre , a crime boss, businessman and politician in Goa running various rackets like kidnapping, extortion and smuggling. Kadam's wife Megha  vows revenge against Jaikant in front of him, exclaiming that God will dispense justice to him for this act.

The story moves to Shivgad, a small village near the Goa-Maharashtra border. Bajirao Singham , an honest police officer like Kadam, is in charge of the Shivgad police station. A station house officer in charge of his town, he resolves most of the problems in his town informally and without filing charge sheets, thereby gaining much reputation and love from the villagers. Gautam ""Gotya"" Bhosle  is an industrialist and Bajirao's father Manikrao ""Manya"" Singham's  childhood friend. He comes to Shivgad with his wife and daughters Kavya  and Anjali . Eventually, Singham and Kavya fall in love with each other. Their courtship takes place through a series of comic events where she initially hates him after he slaps her tight when she is caught frightening villagers disguised as a ghost, but then has a change of heart when she sees his honest and simple nature and finds that he wants to apologize for his behaviour.

Everything seems to run smoothly until Jaikant, who is given conditional bail for a murder he had committed, is required to travel to Shivgad to sign the bail through a fortnight. Acting on the recommendation of his top lieutenant Shiva Naik , he instead sends one of his allies, Vitthal Dalvi, and his men, to do the formalities, much to the fury of Singham who demands Jaikant sign the bail-in person within the next four hours. An enraged Jaikant reaches Shivgad to confront Singham, but the villagers, upon hearing of his comments against Singham, threaten to finish him off, damaging his convoy's vehicles in a dramatic show of public power. Singham asks his assistant, Ramesh Kelkar, to bring the register containing Jaikant's record, forces a thumb impression of Jaikant's left hand onto the register, and warns him to continue signing the bail for the remaining 14 days, as a humiliated Jaikant looks on terrified by Singham's courage and leaves the village on foot as a sign of protest, refusing to travel by wheels. On the highway, as he stops at a point, he recalls his humiliation, learns of Singham's background from Shiva through a source, and using his political contacts, gets Singham transferred to Goa to seek revenge.

Singham, unaware of Jaikant's hand behind his transfer, joins the Colva police station in Goa as the in-charge, when on the very first day, he is confronted by Jaikant, who shows Singham his true colours and tries to intimidate him by mentioning how the officer preceding him ended up committing suicide, warning Singham that he is out to trouble him to no end. Eventually, in a discussion with his co-workers and juniors, Sub-Inspector Dev Phadnis , Sub-Inspector Abbas Malik , and Head Constable Prabhu Sawalkar , he learns how much the three officers hate Jaikant for his crimes but are unable to take any action because of Jaikant's political powers. DSP Satyam Patkar , Singham's senior, is on Jaikant's payroll and takes care of concealing and eliminating the evidence of Jaikant's crime from the eyes of the law. Singham, upon learning of Kadam's tragedy from the colleagues and Megha, and taking cues from what he has already seen, tries to take this to the notice of DGP Vikram Pawar  but it turns out to be of no use as there is no evidence against Jaikant and Patkar. Local minister Anant Narvekar  soon adds to Singham's troubles when he refuses to support him against Jaikant, later launching the latter as a candidate from his local political party. Feeling defeated and mentally tortured by Jaikant to no limits, a worried Singham first contemplates returning home but is stopped by Kavya, who encourages him to fight against the evil and not run away like a coward. At that point, some of Jaikant's henchmen attack him, and he, realizing the futility of returning to Shivgad, brutally beats the goons black and blue, locking them up.

Singham then arrests Shiva in a fake case of illegally smuggling alcohol after setting him up to tear the FIR against the goons, who he had come to free, and recalling to the officers that Shiva, under Jaikant's orders, had planted bundles of cash in Kadam's jeep. Later, he thwarts off Patkar in full view of the public when Patkar, bounded by his duties to Jaikant, tries to bail Shiva out. Jaikant kidnaps Kavya's younger sister Anjali for ransom on Kavya's birthday. Rescuing her, Singham successfully traces the origins of the kidnapping racket to Jaikant, confronting Narvekar with his team in anger, but is unable to arrest him as he wins the election and is set to become a minister of the Goa Government.

Jaikant's party wins the elections, he hands over transfer orders to Singham to go back to Shivgad within 24 hours. That night, at a police function organized for the officers with their families, Singham confronts the officers, particularly Pawar and Patkar, for not abiding by their duties and being dishonest and unfaithful to their profession by protecting Jaikant. At first, Patkar berates Singham, but filled with guilt, Phadnis, Abbas and Sawalkar decide to help Singham fight Jaikant. Soon, he is joined by the entire Goa Police Force, with Pawar also extending support, and all of them invade Jaikant's home to kill him, with Patkar revealing himself to be in support of Singham in a twist. Jaikant eventually escapes but after running through the city, he is arrested by the police the next morning. They bring him to the police station and shoot him dead on Kadam's chair, threatening Shiva moments after the showdown to change his statement. At a media conference, while proving Jaikant and Narvekar guilty, Pawar and Singham clear the late Kadam of all corruption charges.

The film ends with Singham and the other police officers saluting Megha.","['Action', 'Crime', 'Drama']",A truly honest police officer is transferred to a town controlled by a gangster he has humiliated.

10741542,Sherni,Action Adventure Drama Thriller tiger loc reve cubs job kills officer vill tion bout brings time forest lso,Action Adventure Drama Thriller Forest Officer environment upright strives balance world man-animal conflict seeks true calling hostile,"The film begins shortly after Vidya assumes her new position as an officer in the Indian Forest Service. As it is later revealed, this posting is her first fieldwork. Before this, she had a desk job. She is a relatively new officer; the passion that compelled her to pursue this career is still very active. The first time she experiences doubts about her work is when she admonishes a contractor for not filling a watering hole, but then her authority is undermined by her immediate boss, Bansal  because the contractor is the brother of the local MLA.

Vidya’s husband, Pawan , works for a potato chips brand and seems to have this belief ingrained in him that he is perpetually in danger of losing his private-sector job. This puts additional pressure on Vidya as she can’t leave her job despite the growing hostility among the men in power with whom she has to interact every day.Things quickly start to escalate after a tiger ventures close to a village and kills one of the Villagers’ livestock. This brings Vidya into contact with Hassan Noorani , a zoology professor at a local college and ardent conservationist who can gather DNA samples. The idea is to correctly identify the tiger and then capture it so that it can be later released in a national park.

Vidya learns from one of her subordinates that a major issue that conservation efforts face in the area relates to the lay of the land. There are pockets of villages and farms in the forest, and the animals can’t go from one part of the forest to the other without encountering humans, which often proves to be dangerous for both species. This proves to be prophetic when the tiger kills two people. As the election is set to take place soon, the local politicians, both the MLA and his most prominent opponent, get involved. The MLA also brings in a hunter, Ranjan Rajhans or Pintu , who is predictably more concerned about adding to his tally of total kills than intending to use the bullet as a last resort.

It is revealed that the tiger in question is a female codenamed T12. She turns out to be extremely clever and keeps avoiding the traps the forest department sets up to catch her. The footage they get reveals that she has given birth to two cubs, further complicating the matter. As Vidya races against time to capture the tigress and her cubs, a third human death happens. Although it is revealed that the third person died of a bear attack, both government and the locals blame the tigress.After the third human death, villagers are simply unwilling to listen that it was caused by a bear. And because it’s election time, the government goes along with the public sentiment. With the help of Nangia , a highly-respected officer in the department, Vidya got rid of Pintu for a time. But the media attention that the case is getting brings the minister there, who puts both Nangia and Pintu in charge of the entire operation despite Vidya’s protests.She still tries to find the tigers before Pintu, Nangia, and their cohorts. Many of the villagers, including a local woman named Jyoti , helps her in her search, knowing that an atrocious act is about to be committed in their names. One of Pintu’s lackeys acquire urine of a male tiger from a zoo, and they spread it where T12 has previously been spotted. This brings the tigress out, and Pintu kills her. Then he makes a forest officer shoot the dead animal with a tranquilizer dart to show they were forced to kill T12 because she was going to attack them.

Fortunately for the cubs, they are found by Jyoti and her family, and they contact Vidya. Having failed to protect their mother, vidya rushes over. When she sees the two cubs, she hugs Jyoti in joy. The film’s title is a misnomer, as “sherni” in Hindi and some other Indian languages mean lioness. The word “baghin” is used for a tigress. However, sherni also refers to a woman with indomitable courage and conviction, traits that Vidya and Jyoti seem to share.Vidya has become completely disillusioned with her job after what happened to T12. She has also discovered who Nanagia truly is, a pathetic coward who dances to the tune of his political masters. She types up a resignation letter, intending to give it to her superiors once she arrives at the office. She likely knows that they are waiting for her there with transfer orders. But when she is informed that the cubs have been found, she once more feels the joy of knowing that her work actually matters. She tears the paper into two pieces, effectively allowing herself to be transferred. Later, when her replacement arrives, he complains about the contractor just like Vidya did at the start of the film, and the circle begins again.The movie’s final scene reveals that Vidya is now posted in the animal exhibition department of a museum. It’s a relatively easy posting, but she also doesn’t have the real-world power that she used to have in the jungles.

Usha takes the children of her relatives for their swimming lessons, where she is pranked by one of them and almost drowns in the pool. She is rescued by the swimming instructor Jaspal , who calls her by her real name and suggests that she take swimming lessons. Usha begins to fantasize about Jaspal and buys a swimsuit to begin taking lessons from him. She eventually engages in phone sex with him, under the alias of ""Rosy"", while he is under the impression that Rosy is Komal, a young girl who takes lessons from him. Shireen is told by her doctor that she has an infection in her uterus and that she should only use condoms as a contraceptive. She discreetly buys them in chocolate-flavor from the pharmacy, but her husband Rahim refuses to use them while they are having sex.

At Shireen's workplace, her colleague urges her to tell Rahim about her job so that she can secure a promotion and work full-time in an office. Meanwhile, Rehana attends the house party and while she is drunk, she becomes affectionate with Dhruv. She also discovers that Namrata is pregnant. Leela arrives late to a business meeting scheduled with Arshad, who is angered that she is distracted by Manoj and becomes upset with her. She still plans on eloping with Arshad after she realizes that Manoj wishes to keep her as a mundane housewife. Rehana is arrested alongside other college students as she participates in another protest against the jeans ban; however, she manages to handle the situation and receives only a warning from her strictly religious father. Leela tries to convince Arshad to elope with her but he rebukes her and simultaneously, her mother prepones her wedding to the day after Diwali. In her attempts to confront Rahim about her job, Shireen discovers that he is cheating on her with a woman whom he meets regularly at a café. She watches as he treats the woman affectionately and she follows the woman to her home, where she subtly warns her to keep a distance from Rahim and introduces herself as his wife. Usha, feeling confident in Jaspal's positive response to their phone relationship, invites him to the community's Diwali festival. Rehana also decides to go on a date with Dhruv at the same festival, while Namrata is shown to be recovering from an abortion.

Leela attends the festival with Manoj and successfully evokes jealousy in Arshad by kissing Manoj at his photo booth. Arshad fervently kisses Leela when Manoj leaves to get snacks and promises that he will elope with her. Despite this, she attempts to get over him and tries to have sex with Manoj inside the car, who foils her attempt by proclaiming that he wishes to wait until their wedding night. While waiting for Leela, Manoj discovers her sex tape with Arshad and accuses her of cheating, thereby breaking off their engagement.

Rehana passionately kisses Dhruv, while police search for her and find her with Namrata's help. They reveal footage from the mall's security cameras, proving Rehana's theft and arrest her. Dhruv immediately distances himself from Rehana and Namrata reveals that Dhruv was responsible for her pregnancy. Rehana is bailed by her father, who tells her he is ashamed of her and forbids her from returning to college while asking her mother to start looking for prospective grooms.`

As Shireen is receiving her promotion, Rahim steps in to coldly congratulate her before he takes her home and rapes her as punishment for resisting him and approaching the woman he secretly meets. He then mocks her and tells her to quit her job and stay at home.

Usha decides to wear a sleeveless blouse and sari. She gets her armpits waxed with the help of Leela and gets her grey hair dyed black. She looks at herself in the mirror and feels young and eagerly wants to meet Jaspal. Usha spends some time with Jaspal, who eagerly searches for Komal and departs from Usha. He is bewildered when he tries to flirt with Komal and she responds by publicly shaming him. Jaspal realizes that Usha is ""Rosy"" when he finds her novel by the swimming pool and confronts her family members, accusing her of sexually exploiting him. They raid Usha's room and condemn her for ruining their reputation before they throw her erotic novels and swimsuit on the street as the neighbourhood watches.

Rehana, Leela and Shireen help Usha gather her belongings from the road and Usha asks Rehana to finish reading the last few pages of Lipstick Dreams. The four ladies reflect on each of their repressions as they pass a cigarette amongst them and revel in their collective desire for freedom.

Chakravyuh is the story of two best friends: Adil  and Kabir . Adil Khan, a highly decorated police officer is posted to Nandighat, after a horrifying massacre of 84 policemen. The 84 men were led by Adil's good colleague KK, who was acting on the information of an insider from Maoist leader Rajan's gang. However, upon attack KK realizes that it is a trap and the Maoists were ready for the police.Within days, Adil discovers that the Maoists, led by the ruthless and charismatic Rajan , effectively control the area. They are able to swiftly thwart Adil's most determined efforts. Despite holding a position of enormous power as the SP of Nandighat, Adil has never felt so helpless in his career.But then, into his life, re-enters Kabir. Rootless, aimless, the quintessential rolling stone. His only anchor in life has always been his friendship with and his loyalty for Adil. The maverick proposes an outrageous plan: He will infiltrate Rajan's group and be Adil's informer, and together they will smash the Maoist organization in Nandighat. In spite of his apprehensions, Adil agrees.
Sure enough, Kabir gets in and craftily wins their confidence, as only he can. He secretly begins informing Adil, who starts attacking the Maoists with great success. An enormous cache of arms is raided; two top national leaders and 63 activists are killed at an arms-training camp, and Rajan himself is captured. Within weeks, Adil-Kabir turn the game, pushing the Maoists onto the back foot.But Kabir also begins discovering a different reality: The abject helplessness of the rural poor, brutally displaced in the name of development, the fruits of which never reach them; their land, their forest, their water snatched by their own government to allow big business to exploit the area and its people further. As the poverty and desperation rise, so does a cry of anger, giving birth to the Naxalite who believes the only way to counter this is with a gun.Kabir also can't help getting close to the activists. and he begins identifying with them: Rajan; Babu; Venu; and Juhi , a dedicated revolutionary with a tender heart, who has seen pain like none other.

Juhi sacrifices herself in a police raid, to save Kabir. She is raped by the police. Kabir organizes a counterattack to rescue her. The next day Kabir meets Adil & pleads with him to stop the Mahanta project & also tells him about the police brutality on Juhi. Adil refuses to cooperate with the Naxal leanings of Kabir. Adil asks Kabir to finish his mission and come back, but Kabir tells Adil that he now completely with the Naxals and their leader.Kabir organizes an attack on the Mahanta HQ & kidnaps the group head. He then demands Rajan's release in exchange. Adil puts an electronic tracker inside Rajan before exchanging him.

2404027,Arjun: The Warrior Prince,Animation Action Adventure king prince maid story warrior Brihannala bro game young exile life begins art won,Animation Action Adventure Arjun learns student art warfare skilled uncle conspire win belongs,"The story is based on the early life of the Prince Arjuna, loosely taken from the ancient Indian epic Mahabharata. The storyline begins with Arjun as a nine-year-old boy, and follows him until he grows into the warrior that the world knows him as. It explores his life with his brothers in Hastinapur, his training and education, and his ultimate discovery of the warrior within himself.

The film begins with Uttar, the young prince of Viratnagar , asking a maid  to tell him a story. The maid narrates him the story of Arjun.

She tells him that Arjun was a student of Drona, and that he learned the art of warfare from him. He was more skilled than all the students of Drona. None of his own brothers, nor his cousins - the hundred Kauravas - could equal him in the art. Duryodhana and the other Kauravas despised the Pandavas, for they feared that they might usurp Duryodhana's throne. When the king Dhritrashtra grew older, the rivalry between his sons, the Kauravas and the Pandavas intensified. Twice, Duryodhana attempted to kill all the Pandavas, but failed. To avoid further conflict, Dhritrashtra proclaimed Duryodhana as the crown prince of Hastinapur, and asked Yudhishthira to be the king of a distant unkempt territory of the empire.

In the meantime, Arjun won a swayamvar, and married the daughter of the King of Panchala, Draupadi. Duryodhana, who loathed the Pandavas, hatched a conspiracy with his uncle Shakuni and won all that belonged to the Pandavas in a betting game called chaupar. After losing everything, Yudhishthira betted his own brothers and Draupadi, and even himself. Draupadi was insulted in front of everyone, but Arjuna could not say anything because Yudhishthira was the king, and the king's words are the last words. The Pandavas, according to the rules of the game, had to go into exile for twelve years and an agyatavasa  for one year. While all the Pandavas go one way, Arjuna travels North to do tapasya. Before leaving, Draupadi makes him promise that he will take revenge for her insult. He then leaves, and does tapasya, during which he earns a bow from the Lord Shiva.

The story then shifts back to the present day Viratnagar. It is revealed that the Pandavas are spending their secret exile, or 'agyatavasa', there, and are noticed by some of the spies of Duryodhana. According to the outcome of the game, if any one of the Pandavas is found before the end of that one year, the Pandavas will have to again go for a twelve-year exile. The spy informs Duryodhana that the Pandavas are in Viratnagar. So he launches an attack on Viratnagar with the help of his bandit friends. The king of Viratnagar leaves to thrash the marauding bandits. However, that is the bait. From the other direction, Duryodhana's army comes, and it seems that the young prince of Viratnagar is the only one who is left to fight.

Uttar's maid drives the young prince's chariot to the field, but the prince, distraught by the number of enemies, flees. The maid stops him, and reveals her true identity: the maid  comes out as Arjun. Arjun retrieves his bow and makes prince Uttar drive his chariot. The warrior massacres the army and emerges victorious, and at last, Arjuna alone defeats all Kaurava warriors, including Bhisma and Drona.","['Animation', 'Action', 'Adventure']","Arjun, a Pandava, learns the art of warfare from Drona and becomes his most skilled student.

During a shootout, Arjun successfully apprehends Rehman and thwarts a suicide bomber attack, saving the bomber, who happens to be Rehman's son, Hamid Gul.

Fast forward 12 years, Arjun meets and falls in love with Ayesha, an air hostess, at Mumbai Airport. Tragedy strikes when the airport is attacked by Hamid's men, resulting in Ayesha's death, and leaving Arjun paralyzed from the neck down. V. K. Subramaniam, Chief of Indian Intelligence and Arjun's superior officer, proposes an ambitious AI-operated supersoldier program to the Prime Minister. DRDO scientist Sabaha Qureshi, who has been working on the supersoldier program for seven years, is on the verge of a major breakthrough.

The Prime Minister approves the program, and Arjun is chosen as the candidate. Despite his initial hesitation, Arjun agrees, driven by the desire to avenge Ayesha's death. Arjun undergoes the transformation, interfacing with the Intelligent Robotic Assistant , which is governed by his own mental commands, albeit with certain limitations due to his trauma.

The government learns of Hamid's efforts to acquire chemical weapons in Eastern Europe. Sabaha presents her progress on Arjun's transformation to the Defence Minister at the Parliament. In a conversation with I.R.A, Arjun uncovers Hamid's sinister plan to attack the Parliament and quickly informs Subramaniam, who is present at Sansad Marg.

Hamid and his terrorists, disguised as Rapid Action Force personnel, successfully hijack the Parliament, taking hostages, including the Prime Minister and Sabaha. Arjun, along with National Security Guard  commandos, heads towards the Parliament, but Hamid issues a demand—withdraw the NSG from the vicinity or face dire consequences. Subramaniam urges the Caretaker Prime Minister Digvijay Singh to proceed with a partial extraction. Simultaneously, Arjun is instructed to covertly infiltrate the Parliament to relay critical information.

With I.R.A's assistance, Arjun gains access to the Parliament, eliminates some guards, and provides Subramaniam with live surveillance feeds. As Hamid pushes for the release of Rehman, Sabaha falls into the clutches of a terrorist named Hussain. Arjun intervenes, eliminating Hussain and rescuing Sabaha. Arjun eventually exposes himself to Hamid via a walkie-talkie, leading to a tense standoff. Hamid demands that Digvijay, Subramaniam, and other officials instruct Arjun to surrender, which Arjun reluctantly agrees to. He is brought before Hamid, who unexpectedly strikes Arjun's neck, causing a malfunction in I.R.A.

Hamid insists on receiving safe passage to escape to Ecuador via an airplane, releasing the hostages but activating a deadly sarin gas bomb set to detonate within the Parliament. Rehman is freed from prison and heads to the airport. Sabaha retrieves her laptop and successfully reboots I.R.A, enabling Arjun to eliminate the terrorists one by one. Arjun keeps Subramaniam informed about the bomb's presence and insists they intercept Hamid. However, Hamid manages to escape through an old tunnel and heads for the airport in an ambulance.

Arjun instructs Sabaha to evacuate with the hostages and sets off in pursuit of Hamid, leading to a dramatic showdown at the airport. Arjun crashes the ambulance, eventually confronting and defeating Hamid. He deactivates the bomb and saves the day. Sabaha successfully rescues the hostages, while NSG Commandos eliminate Rehman by ejecting him mid-flight.

He could have been a cricketer if not for his tennis elbow; he could have been an IAS officer but wanted to teach kids to be IAS instead; or he fell sick right before an important exam, which is why he is now teaching history instead of already being a part of it. These are some of the lies he has told around the whole town to ""maintain an image."" Ajay loves his image in town and wants to protect it at all costs.
The Principal  of the school gets several complaints from fellow teachers who believe Ajay is a fake, but due to lack of any evidence, the Principal does not take any action.
Ajay also lives with his parents and buys expensive items to maintain his aura in town. His dad refuses to fund his lavish lifestyle.Ajay married Nisha  some nine months ago, but he has never liked her. Nisha told him before they got married that she had epilepsy, but since she hadn't had a fit in over ten years, Ajay decided it wasn't a problem for him. Ajay married Nisha because he thought she would help him enhance his image. While Nisha selected Ajay as she saw him as friendly and compassionate, not knowing that it was only his image.
However, on the day of their marriage, she had a fit, and since then, Ajay has been disappointed in her because he is embarrassed about other people finding out. He doesn't let her work a job or even take her anywhere because he is scared of what people will think of him if she has a fit again. Nisha has not left him because she has some hope.One morning in school, when he is in a particularly bad mood, he slaps one of his students Atul  for asking him a question related to the subject. Atul wanted to know why prisoners were stripped of their clothes before being taken to gas chambers in concentration camps. When Ajay couldn't answer, Atul mocked him for not knowing, hence prompting the slap.That gets him into trouble because the boy is the MLA's Vishwas Raghuvanshi  son, and he gets involved. Ajay is suspended for a few days, and he could potentially lose his job, which he cannot afford because he wants to keep up his image.
Therefore, he comes up with a plan to go on a tour of Europe and visit all the places relevant to World War II so that he can teach the kids about them through a live-stream, covering up the fact of his incompetence in the classroom. He plans on taking Nisha with him so that his father Mr Dixit  will agree to finance the trip, but he tells her that it is only for show, and he is not actually interested in their relationship.
When Nisha thanks Ajay, he retorts that he only included her so that his father would fund the trip. He actually wants Nisha to go to her home from the airport and meet him only once he returns.A fed-up Nisha decides not to put up with his nonsense anymore and to go to Europe regardless. He could go his way, and she would do what she wanted. Unfortunately, though, things immediately go wrong for Ajay, and his bag is exchanged with another man Kalpesh , leaving Ajay with terrible clothes for the duration of his trip. He is also not able to figure out his day and how to go about the city, while Nisha goes on to have an excellent time. When they get back to the hotel, Ajay sees this and understands that he needs her help to navigate Europe, and Nisha agrees, saying that she isn't going to abandon him the way he did to her.Since Ajay is shameless and Nisha is a pushover, this couple sets out to explore the city, and it is Nisha who tells Ajay the facets of history that he then starts relaying to his students.

Back in Lucknow, his videos on history are a hit and are gaining good attention, despite the MLA insisting that a committee be set up to decide on his suspension.When a video of Ajay dancing with Nisha is uploaded by her on her social media page, it goes viral, and Ajay is furious since he believes that it could hurt his chances with his job. In his anger, he says some really mean things to her, and Nisha finally decides to leave him behind and sign the divorce papers back home.Ajay visits a Berlin Museum, where he sees the last things that the people grabbed before they were scurried away to concentration camps. When he imagines himself in their situation, he realizes that Nisha means something to him, and he asks her to stay back for the rest of the trip instead of leaving midway. Nisha agrees. This is just another undeserved chance for Ajay.
When they are in Auschwitz, they meet a concentration camp survivor who tells them how he should have paid more attention to his wife. Ajay relates this to his own situation, and this is what it took for him to learn to see Nisha as a person instead of a ""misfire,"" as he called her and their marriage.
This time, when she has a fit, he is there for her and really takes care of her.Ajay returns to India and tells the committee that he was never a good teacher and will accept whatever verdict they have reached. To his surprise, the committee decided in his favor because when they conducted a test for the students, they all aced it, thanks to Ajay's history lessons from Europe.
Now that Ajay is a changed man, he has the respect of the MLA and the approval of all of his students, meaning that he is going to live his life as a changed person with the help of his wife.","['Action', 'Drama', 'Romance']",A small-town man who falls in love with the most beautiful girl in town.

18413766,Kathal: A Jackfruit Mystery,Comedy Crime Drama Mystery police missing men Basor jack-fruits gardener area girls kidnapped works girl find finds local,Comedy Crime Drama Mystery local politician prized jackfruits missing young police officer adamant solve bizarre case prove,"Mahima Basor  is a competent police officer, but there are often whispers behind her back regarding her caste. She specializes in solving crimes against women and has played a leading role in arresting many women harassers in the area.
Mahima works under SP Angrez Singh Randhawa . News reporter Anuj Sanghvi  works for the local newspaper.
However, she has learned to ignore them while keeping up with her work. Her goal currently is for her long-term boyfriend, Saurabh , to get promoted from a constable to an inspector so that they can get married. Before that can happen, they get a new case, that of two missing jack-fruits from a local MLA Munnalal Pateria's  house, which they must find at any cost. Mahima rightfully believes that this is a waste of police time and resources, but she has no option but to investigate.Munnalal wanted to gift the pickle made from the stolen jack-fruits to gift to the state CM and his wife who are big fans of jack-fruit pickles. This would improve his chances to get a minister portfolio in the Government. Bindeshwari is Munnalal's wife.
Forensic expert Srivastava  is summoned to investigate. Srivastava takes POP impressions of foot marks around the jack-fruit tree. The prints belonging to a cow are categorized as that of a lady wearing high heel sandals. Constable Mishra  is assisting Mahima in the investigations. Constable Kunti Parihar  is the female assistant helping Mahima. Kunti is married to Adv. Sunil Parihar .Mishra begs Saurabh to marry his daughter. Mishra had fixed her wedding to a family that demands a car as dowry. Mishra had purchased a car, but it was stolen. Now, he has nothing to offer to the perspective groom and hence begs Saurabh.
Anuj meanwhile interviews Munnalal about his missing Jackfruits.Mahima discovers that the gardener Birwa was fired two days ago, and she suspects that he might be the thief. Lucky for her, the gardener himself walks into the police station, wanting to file a missing complaint for his daughter.Upon discovering his identity, Mahima immediately locks him up in a cell and questions him regarding the jack-fruits. It turns out that the gardener was unceremoniously fired after the grandson of the MLA misinterpreted his words and made it sound like he was being threatened by him. But the gardener had been at the police station for a day or two to report his daughter missing.
However, he was turned away by Saurabh, who believed that the girl must have run away of her own accord and would return soon. Mahima is extremely disappointed in Saurabh upon knowing this, as it puts the future of their relationship in greater danger.Mahima desperately wants Saurabh to get a promotion since that would help his parents overlook the caste barrier between them if they were professional equals, at least. But Saurabh indiscriminately beats up some people and is inattentive at his job, which puts Mahima in a difficult position as his boss. She is unable to fully reprimand him owing to their relationship, but she is also unable to trust him as a colleague.Temporarily, regarding the case, Mahima comes up with a solution: the gardener must say that it was his daughter Amiya who stole the jack-fruits so that the police can divert their resources to look for the girl.
The ruse works, and the investigation starts. Mahima finds that several girls have been kidnapped from the area in the recent past.
When they inquire in the gardener's village about her, they find that she was recently kidnapped by three men. Amiya used to consume tobacco, which was sold to her by a local shopkeeper. Under interrogation, the shopkeeper reveals that he had seen Amiya with 3 men selling sunglasses in the village. The 3 men were driving a Nano car.Anuj interviews Birwa and finds the truth that police had lied. Mahima intercepts Anuj and gives him the file of all the kidnapped girls from the area and asks Anuj to cooperate with the police in finding and rescuing Amiya.
Meanwhile, Saurabh redeems himself by finding the address of the people who sold sunglasses in that area. Saurabh had got the list of all mobile numbers active on the day Amiya was abducted. He found that all except 3 numbers were locals. The 3 numbers were registered to the same man, who ran an optical shop with his 3 sons.
The men who kidnapped Amiya  were also selling sunglasses. As Mahima reaches the optical shop, the owner admits that he had a servant named Bhoora who had all his identity documents. Bhoora ran away from the shop 2 weeks ago. Bhoora had won the owners trust by treating him with a special Khoya Jalebi.Through them, Mahima and her officers discover that these men must have gone to Chhatarpur. They track the CCTV footage of the city and track down the pink Nano that the 3 men were driving.
Anuj leaks the news of 43 kidnappings in the area. SP is livid and orders Mahima to arrest Anuj.Mahima tracks the pink Nano between a fuel pump and a highway Dhaba on the way to Chhatarpur. It is shown that the 3 men are working for Gulab Seth , who is based out of Panna. They activate the phone to call Gulab, and Mahima is able to track them down. Before Mahima reaches there, the men have departed and their phones are switched off again.
Mahima ultimately figures out that they must go to the house of the man who was the only one in the area to make Khoya Jalebi, Gulab Seth. True to her suspicions, Mahima finds Amiya there, and after a long fight where a lot of vegetables are thrown around, the police capture the culprits.The reason the MLA was so desperate for the jack-fruits was that he needed to make a pickle out of them to impress someone for his own political ambitions. He couldn't get similar jack-fruits in the market since these were grown from imported seeds. Hence, he sought the help of the police to find his missing fruits.Once Amiya is rescued and taken to court, she is further shamed by the lawyers to present her as the kind of person who would steal something unabashedly. The gardener admits that he lied to the media and the police at Mahima's insistence. When Mahima is asked to explain her actions, she tells the court how she was forced to take such a step to focus on the more pressing matter, which was the missing girl rather than a missing fruit. The judge understands Mahima's point and reprimands the police for using their resources for something that barely costs Rs. 360 in the market. Mahima is not charged with anything, and Amiya is also released from custody. Amiya continues leading a life on her terms and has not been deterred by the obsolete thinking of society.On the other hand, the reporter, Anuj , is released from jail, where he was being held for publishing the news about the girls missing from the area. He takes it as a mark of respect that he was arrested, as he believes that it is a feather in the cap of any reporter. As for Mahima, she is put in charge of a special cell that has been formed with the sole purpose of investigating the cases of the missing girls.
In her personal life, Saurabh gets the promotion he wanted, but Mahima is also made the DSP. An elated Saurabh reassures her that they will not let this become a hindrance to their future.The monkeys around the MLA's house stole the jack-fruits from his tree and are eating them while perched on his rooftop.","['Comedy', 'Crime', 'Drama', 'Mystery']",A local politician whose prized jackfruits go missing and a young police officer who is adamant to solve this bizarre case to prove herself.,"Article 15,Singham,Samrat &amp; Co.,Thar,Cuttputlli,Jazbaa"

15680228,Bheed,Drama History people police caste checkpoint mall times food community migr bus lower girl,Drama History homes toughest times people face reach,"The Central Government announced a countrywide lock-down on March 24, 2020, in order to tackle the spread of the virus. But since a massive part of this country's population relies on daily wages, the shutdown rendered them penniless, and they had no choice but to return to their villages or towns. However, the unavailability of proper transport forced them to walk for thousands of kilometers. When they were stopped on highways and roads, they took to the railway tracks, assuming that the movement of trains had been stopped. ""Bheed"" opens with the death of those migrating Indians who died on those train tracks while taking a breather from their seemingly endless journey.
A checkpoint around Tejpura where Surya , along with Ram Singh , and many other police officers are supposed to prevent anyone crossing interstate borders. Surya has been appointed Officer in Charge for the first time, by his superior Inspector Yadav and he is keen to impress.There are multiple narratives that converge at that police checkpoint in Tejpura. Surya belongs to a Tikas community that's deemed lower caste in India. He and his family have faced caste-ism all their lives. So, Surya's father has removed his last name from his identification documents so that he doesn't have to face the same going forward. Surya works for Inspector Subhash Yadav , who has ordered him to set up a check point at Tejpura border and stop any migrants from crossing state lines.
He's in a relationship with Dr. Renu , who belongs to an upper-caste family. Since they want to marry each other, Surya wonders if Renu's family is ever going to accept him as Renu's husband. Renu warns him that if Surya doesn't do anything, then Renu's father is going to forcefully make her marry someone of his choice. Surya reminds her that people hailing from the lower caste community have always fought for their rights, and even in this scenario, he is expected to get the brickbats, while Renu's father causes all the chaos. Dr Renu is called upon to check on symptomatic patients at the checkpoint.Trivedi  is a security guard who is traveling to his home along with many other people from his village. His brother has been infected with the COVID-19 virus, but he refuses to believe that and assumes that everything will be fixed if he gets to enter his village. Trivedi's lack of scientific knowledge, causes him to lash out against anyone who is trying to stop him.
Suraj orders infected people at the checkpoint to be sanitized and moved to a make shift isolation area near the mall . Trivedi refuses to allow his brother to be moved and argues with both Ram Singh and Suraj. Trivedi is arrogant about his upper caste status.
In the argument, Suraj reveals his caste status, which Trivedi comes to know about.
Trivedi begins to discriminate against a bus full of people from the Muslim community as he blames them for being the main reason behind the spreading of the Coronavirus. He even rejects the food packets that one of the Muslim elders was distributing to help the people on Trivedi's bus.
The mob forces the Muslims to get back into their own bus, on the charge that they are the ones spreading Corona.
However, upon realizing that religious lines created by human beings don't matter in a situation like this, he goes back to the Muslim elder and asks for some food. Alas, by then, all the food packets had been distributed. In addition to all that, Trivedi flaunts his Hindu, upper-caste status in front of Surya when he tries to stop Trivedi from entering the nearby mall and stealing food.A mother  who is trying to reach her daughter before her husband does, and her fate is in the hands of her driver, Kanhaiya .
There's a girl  who is trying to get her drunkard father  and herself to their village by any means possible. The girls strikes a deal with a truck driver to transport them for rs 3500, but the father spent the money on liquor. Disgusted at his selfishness, the girl leaves her father.
There is the journalistic team led by reporter Vidhi Prabhakar , who is interviewing anyone she can get her hands on at the police checkpoint.
The girl and a drunkard father are found in a cement mixer, which had the paperwork to pass the checkpoint. Unfortunately, the truck got stuck in a ditch and noises were heard from inside the truck and it was emptied, revealing the smuggled migrants.
Although the mother appears to be an empathetic figure, she shows her upper-class opportunistic mindset. The girl and her father had found a way through the check post and the mother followed her. But when they fell into a ditch, she refused to help them. Thankfully, Kanhaiya is there to remind her that if people don't help each other during these difficult times, then they are worse than animals.
Vidhi is there to show how journalism can be important when it comes to showing government complacency and blatant moments of oppression.According to the Indian Express, around 8700 people returning to their respective homes died on the train tracks. Of course, those are the official numbers. The unreported statistics can be far higher than that. Trivedi wonders why people are talking about borders between neighboring states. In India, there wasn't any such thing until the national lock-down in 2020. The Government evidently did it to stop the infections. However, due to the lack of infrastructure or guidelines, or training, in terms of how to handle large amounts of sick and starving crowds, these checkpoints only increased the harassment and anxiety that the people of India were facing.WhatsApp forwards, Facebook posts, and incendiary reporting by the mainstream media in India these three things caused a lot of damage in an already unprecedented situation. As per The Wire, a lot of COVID-19 misinformation was spread through Whatsapp without being fact-checked.
The Economic Times reported that Facebook had to team up with eight fact-checking organizations to ensure that their feed wasn't filled with all kinds of fake news and misinformation. Muslim community was specifically targeted. It all began with the members of the Tablighi Jamaat that got stuck in India due to the COVID-19 lock-down.
As per the official page of Human Rights Watch, the Indian media even came up with all kinds of Islamophobic terms to fuel hatred against Muslims. Things got so bad that the World Health Organization had to issue a request not to profile people according to their caste, creed, or religion because the COVID-19 virus clearly doesn't see such man-made boundaries. Eventually, everyone found out that none of the members of the Tablighi Jamaat were guilty of spreading the COVID-19 virus. However, not a single member of the Indian media or the Indian civil society came forward to apologize for the Demonization that they partook in.The makeshift health wards and the lack of hospital beds shown is nothing in comparison to the dreadful scenarios that the people of India had to face. According to DW, hospitals faced a shortage of trained medical individuals dealing with the never-ending line of infected people. They were running out of oxygen cylinders. People had to sleep on the floor, in the parking lot, or in the ambulances they were arriving in to avoid crowding the corridors of the hospitals. The lack of sanitary pads is mentioned twice, which is yet another real crisis that the girls of India had to face. As reported by the BBC, schools were one of the biggest sources of free sanitary napkins for girls. But since they were closed due to the corona-virus lock-down, they had to purchase them, thereby highlighting that something as essential as a sanitary pad isn't available for free in India. Migrants are cleansed by spraying a sanitizing liquid on them. That happened in Bareilly, according to the BBC, and sparked such an outrage that India's Ministry of Health and Welfare had to release an advisory. NDTV reported that 18 migrants were found hiding in a cement mixer truck to get to Lucknow. In addition to all that, the police brutality displayed is nothing in comparison to the real thing where, as per QZ, the police used guns, batons, and everything in their arsenal to beat up citizens under the garb of preventing them from flouting COVID-19 norms.Seeing that things are taking a turn for the worse, Surya requests his superior, Yadav , to turn the nearby mall into a refuge for the people to rest up, eat, and freshen up. But Yadav exposes his caste-ism by saying that people belonging to the lower classes aren't allowed to enter a mall after it's built. They are only allowed to enter the premises when they are being built.
At the same time, Trivedi gives Surya an ultimatum: if he and his police forces don't allow him to enter the mall and procure some food items for the people on his bus, he's going to do the same forcefully. Renu tells Surya that Trivedi is not wrong. Surya's sense of justice has to be different from the brand dispensed by the upper castes.Yadav is frustrated as his parents have Corona and he is not able to secure a hospital bed for them. The hospital administrator has kept the beds reserved for members of his own community.
Yadav takes additional forces to the checkpoint himself.
After an hour goes by, all hell breaks loose as Trivedi makes his way to the mall. While the police partake in brutality, Trivedi unleashes his caste-ism on Surya and even grabs a gun to protect himself while stealing food from the mall.
Surya goes after him to calm him down and help him help everyone else. However, since Yadav and Ram Singh escalate things by going after Trivedi with guns, Surya plots Trivedi's escape by staging a hostage situation, with Surya acting as Trivedi's hostage.Surya and Trivedi drive off into the distance on a bike, and the police chase them down. When Surya thinks that the police aren't nearby anymore, he advises Trivedi to take the bike and run away. Trivedi realizes that that means he won't be able to help the people on his bus and blames Surya for misleading him. Surya says that he's helping him get away from a volatile situation, and he should be thankful for that. Trivedi, unable to understand what's his crime, wonders why he has to run away just because he demanded food, shelter, and water.
Although Surya doesn't give a direct answer, he essentially insinuates that people from lower castes have historically faced oppression for fighting for their basic rights and items that are essential for survival.
When they part ways, Yadav nabs Surya and Ram Singh nabs Trivedi.In the heat of the moment, Surya tells Yadav that he isn't going to bow down to anyone because of the family he was born into and the caste system that upper-caste people still continue to promote to this day. Although he's probably going to lose his job, Surya ensures that the check-post stands till the end of the day. He feeds all the migrants with food from the mall.
But even if he succeeds in keeping his job, he has to start another fight, which is to make sure that he doesn't become a victim of caste violence after marrying Renu.
On the flip side, Trivedi avoids a police encounter by pouring all the money in his pockets into Ram Singh's hands. Upper caste folk always have a way out because they've people in every department to look after their own. Meanwhile, if someone from a lower caste community tries to break the wheel, they'll probably end up getting hurt, and the proverbial wheel will keep turning.
The checkpoint, which is filled with migrant workers waiting to go home, thereby serving as a stark reminder of a horrific chapter in the history of modern India.","['Drama', 'History']",The toughest times people had to face just to reach their homes.,"Rakhta Charitra 2,Unlock Zindagi,Sooryavanshi,Khelein Hum Jee Jaan Sey,Bharat,Shor in the City"

Khilauna
The story opens with Meenal losing electricity at her home.

Meenal is a street-smart housemaid who lives in the slums along with her little sister Binny. She struggles to make ends meet and send her little sister to school. She works in a rich locality for a lady who is struggling to conceive. It is shown that Meenal holds contempt for the rich people she works for. When told about her electricity problem, her employer mentions that she could seek help from Vinod Agarwal, the new secretary of the locality. In the same locality is Sushil, who owns a small laundry stall. While in the locality, Sushil is seen cussing Meenal and his sister, but behind everyone's back, they are lovers. The story keeps flipping back and forth between the present, where Meenal is shown to be at a police station with a policewoman inquiring her about the 'incident' and her telling that she had nothing to do with it. It is shown that Vinod Agarwal has a pregnant wife and has the hots for Meenal. He finds her at Sushil's stall and asks her to work at his place to help his wife. Meenal happily agrees, hoping to get in a word with him regarding electricity at her place. Meenal leaves her previous employer for Vinod Agarwal, and she is shown to have a good bond with the pregnant wife. When the wife is away, Vinod makes a move at Meenal, asking her to have sex with him if she needs electricity back. Binny witnesses this. Meenal leaves crying and goes to Sushil's stall. He is concerned and asks her about what happened. Later, Vinod Agarwal also arrives at Sushil's stall and starts hitting him for flirting with women and being insolent. Passers-by stop this fight, and the secretary apologizes for his misconduct. Vinod also invites Meenal, Sushil, and Binny to a party he and his wife are hosting to celebrate the birth of their son. We switch to the present, and we see the police bringing Sushil to the station and beating him up. Meenal is warned that if she doesn't reveal what she did, it would be Binny's screams she'd be hearing next. Sushil begs the police to stop hitting him and tells him that he didn't do anything except breaking the transformer and that Vinod Agarwal made a move on Meenal. Meenal takes the name of her previous employer, saying she did it as she was jealous that she was infertile. We're taken back to the party where we see Meenal, Binny, Abha  taking turns with the baby. Sushil arrives and is shown to be very angry. He steals some alcohol and heads out of the party, drunk, and breaks the transformer, leading to a power cut in the party. Vinod Agarwal and his wife get some flashlights and realize their baby is missing. They look for him, and Vinod goes to the kitchen to see the pressure cooker releasing blood instead of water. Abha arrives at the police station and says something to the police. The police then search Binny's bag and find the baby's toy in there. When asked if she took it from the baby, Binny replies that she did so because the baby was just a toy.

She then reveals to Priya that she's Bharti Mandal and that her family belongs to the lower Dalit caste whose women are traditionally in the midwifery business. This causes a change in Priya's attitude.

Priya is then thrown a surprise birthday party in the office with her company's higher officials. Bharti is not allowed and is only called in to serve cake to everyone. Bharti cries, and when Priya comes to her, she tells her that the best way to deal with her internal conflict is to have a baby and become a mother just like Kavita. She then goes on to help Priya conceive while she handles Priya's work. A now pregnant Priya goes on maternity leave, recommending Bharti to take over her responsibilities. After the birth, Bharti visits Priya. Priya's husband mentions that she'd return to work soon, but Priya's mother-in-law is completely against it. She asks Bharti for her opinion since she comes from a family of midwives. Bharti recommends against returning to work. Bharti goes to work and is told that Priya has quit and Bharti can now take over the job completely.

2176013,Jab Tak Hai Jaan,Drama Romance Major plot love romance Lord Punjabi bomb life entire time young musician,Drama Romance director contemporary uncompromising film true love legendary unforgettable fascinatingly distinctive,"It quite turned out to be driving a skeptical audience to predict the entire plot in the first quarter hour, but several twists and grooves kept them absorbed to the center plot in fine. A typical ""Yash Raj Films"" banner title with four crispy short words and the obvious protagonist Shah Rukh Khan, the swansong of ardent late Yash Raj was drenched in suspense, thrill and sated romance playing hide and seek with the impeccable beauty of Ladakh and London.Akira, Anushka Sharma, a profile photographer journalist in the Discovery was struggling hard to get a footage of Major Samar Anand, Shah Rukh, rescuing her from a false act of drowning. Samar could paint Akira's mind with a hue of his pain in life before edifying her, and left her with the diary of his life's bleak glum past.The movie goes back in time and shows the entire flashback of Samar, a waiter and a young musician, and Meera , an NRI and a high class successful businesswoman. Meera craved to marry a British and was engaged. The NRI caught glimpses of the young musician performing on the streets apart from trading wishes with Lord. Despite promising not to ""cross the line"", she was all swept off her feet by charming Samar juggling fedora, in a dickered deal that he would teach her Punjabi song and she'd guide her to speak flawless English. They fell in love until the eclectic climax hauled at an accident Samar encountered following which Meera took down her chance of getting along him wishing her last.It twisted to the scene when Major Samar defused another bomb without any safety precautions as he haggled his chances of survival with Lord's choice of bringing Meera back to him. Meanwhile the gutsy prevaricating Akira lounging on her part of romance into Major Samar's unrequited love story, pranced up to the military arena in volleyball shorts, to set up her career in the Discovery chronicling the seemingly Sergeant William James; of course falling for the romance hero and getting reciprocated intermittently. Finally a second accident put up a black rose to his ten-year old memory bedding him at the hospital to retrograde amnesia. Meera was summoned; later she revealed she was not married and kept her love ringing through the last decade while Major Samar proved his charisma aplomb in defusing 98 consecutive bombs without security gears. Meera proved her mettle in the first part in helping him recover and later Akira, the pert with her quirks and pizzazz brought him to present day Major whose memory metamorphosed his ability to defuse a bomb inside a train in London.Major Samar took his final bet on life precariously as Meera succumbed to her emotions and gave into her wisdom of love on the spot of bomb diffusal in a white chiffon saree. Both the shift of persona in the characters of Samar and Akira were glaring towards the latter half as the climaxes play the musical chair. A. R. Rahman's music background did not cater for his cliché in most of the scores, neither the Punjabi song suited SRK's chords, but all-in-all, the three-hour long saga gave us superficial medleys of Baazigar, Veer Zaara and traffic-stopping guitarist ""Karan"" and ""Raj"" from the career of the 47-year old romance hero dubbed as a 28-year old in the movie.","['Drama', 'Romance']",An uncompromising film on true love from the legendary and unforgettable director Yash Chopra which is fascinatingly distinctive and contemporary.,"Teri Meri Kahaani,Lust Stories,Khamoshiyan,Shikara,Ek Paheli Leela,Unpaused"

While the parents are enjoying their trip, the family gets to know about a natural calamity that has hit Uttarakhand. After one phone call, the family fails to reconnect with the aged parents. Jamnadas Pandey then travels to Uttarakhand himself to look for his missing parents only to come back home disappointed. He still doesn’t give up and keeps visiting government offices and officials to enquire about his parents. 

When the officials come to know that it’s been over 25 days that the couple is missing, they tell Jamnadas to consider them dead and accept a compensation of 14 lakhs. After much introspection, Jamnadas accepts the possibility that his parents might have indeed died in the calamity and accepts the compensation. But the official offers him only 10 lakhs in person while on-paper, the compensation still remains 14 lakhs. 


Jamnadas, without arguing with the officials, takes whatever money he gets and uses it to fulfil all his parents’ wishes. As time passes, Jamnadas’ parents come back, hale and hearty and alive.

Sakshi is teased by three children and grows curious about them. Devi warns her to stay away from them but Sakshi doesn't listen. Devi, frustrated that Sakshi is not listening, threatens her. Things sour between her and Sakshi after this. A few days later, Hemant returns and Sakshi asks him to take her somewhere else in a fit of panic. That night, as they are leaving, the couple is attacked by Devi and a ritual is performed on Sakshi by devi and her husband. Devi takes her back to her room and ties her to the bed.

Devi tells her that she must stay there alone for next three days in order to get rid of Sunaini, Devi's sister-in-law and a ghost, who once was pregnant. She killed Devi's three little boys, her own husband, and then herself by cutting her womb when she was pregnant. Sunaini cursed Devi's family, ensuring they cannot continue their lineage. Devi tells Sakshi that all the visions she will see in the next three days will be illusions. Sakshi tries to escape the house but in vain.

It is revealed that Sunaini was being asked by her in-laws to kill her fetus because of it being a female child. When she refused and tried to escape, she accidentally killed her own husband. Devi's family, thinking Sunaini killed her husband, burned her alive. In the process, she gave birth to her baby but her baby was thrown in the well to fulfill a ritual that guarantees a good harvest. Sunaini, in her burned state, jumps into the well to save her daughter. Devi's three boys, who loved Sunaini, jumped in after her to save them, resulting in all of them dying and becoming ghosts.

Sakshi experiences the ordeal Sunaini went through in a series of harrowing experiences. In the final moments, before being made to self-harm her baby by Sunaini, she makes an oath to tell everyone of the ordeal that Sunaini went through if the ghost lets her go instead of repeating the same torment on the new wives. Sakshi survives the three days and in the morning when Devi, the driver and Hemant come, she refuses to leave without revealing the story.

Hemant is revealed to be Rajbir, who killed his previous two wives because he was afraid they would tell people about the murders in the village. He spared Rani because she swore to stay silent. As Rajbir goes to attack Sakshi from behind, Rani kills him with a cleaver. Sakshi walks away from the village house, through the sugarcane field in the direction given by the three ghost children. She is joined by Rani.","['Drama', 'Horror', 'Thriller']",Eight-month pregnant Sakshi must save herself and her unborn child from the evil within society and from the fear that lies in the paranormal world.,"Kaali Khuhi,Aiyyaa,Jai Mummy Di,Tadka,Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster 3,Tumbbad"

2939912,Traffic,Adventure Drama Thriller named heart police wanted road group make man van people accident friend city working sick,Adventure Drama Thriller emotional thriller based road trip Inspired real events happened,"The story of Traffic is about something that happened in Chennai, India, and it all happens in just one day.

In Mumbai city, there is a police officer named Ramdas Godbole who had to stop working for a while because he did something wrong. He took money from people even though he wasn't supposed to . There is also a young person named Rehan Ali who wants to be a journalist and is about to start his first day of work.

They stopped their car at a traffic light where a famous heart doctor named Dr. Abel Fernandes and his friend Hemaan were also waiting. But while they were waiting, Rehan and his friend Rajeev got into an accident.

Rehan is very sick and his brain has stopped working, but his heart is still beating. He is being helped to breathe by a machine called a ventilator. In another city, a famous actor's daughter named Ria is also very sick and needs a new heart as soon as possible. The doctors looking for a heart for Ria find out that Rehan's heart is still working well and can be given to Ria. At first, Rehan's mom and dad are unsure about taking him off the ventilator, but Rehan's best friend Rajeev and girlfriend Aditi tell them that this is a way to save another person's life.

Now that we have the heart, the only problem is getting it from Mumbai to Pune. Because of bad weather and poor visibility, we can't use helicopters or planes to transport it. So, the only choice we have is to take it by road.

A person named Gurbir Singh, who is in charge of traffic, is asked to do a difficult and risky task. At first, he doesn't want to do it because it's hard and dangerous. But after being convinced by someone named Dr. Simon D'Souza, he decides to take on the task.

Because it was very dangerous, none of the police officers wanted to do the difficult job. But Godbole, who wanted to earn back the respect he lost because of a bad thing he did, offered to be the driver of the police van that would take the heart to Pune. He was joined by Dr. Abel and Rajeev on this important mission.

Once upon a time, everything was going well. But then, a man named Dr. Abel did something very scary. He put a knife on another man named Rajeev's neck and made him go a different way. Rajeev got really mad and fought back. Dr. Abel called his sister and told her that he had hurt his wife because she was being mean to him. He didn't want to get in trouble with the police, so he wanted to run away. Another man named Dev Kapoor tried to help Dr. Abel, but he wasn't sure if he should trust him. Dev's wife, Maya, told Dr. Abel about how worried she was about their sick daughter. She said that nothing could be worse than that. Dr. Abel listened to her and told Rajeev and the other man, Godbole, to go away. But Godbole wanted to take Dr. Abel with them, even though the police wanted to catch him.

They were driving on a road and had to pay a toll. They drove faster to make up for time they lost in a forest. Then they had to drive really fast to reach their destination. But then they came to a place where the road was blocked because of an accident. In another city, a group of people were talking about taking a different route if they were a little bit behind. But they were worried because there was a sensitive area on that route. The driver heard all of this and decided to take that route anyway. The group said that the police couldn't do anything because of the strong minority in that area, and now the success of their mission depends on the public's support.

Dev Kapoor calls Aslam Khan, who is a very important person in Bilal Colony. Aslam goes out of his way to make sure that the police van can drive without any problems. Rajeev knows the area really well, so as soon as they enter the colony, he gets out of the van to make sure the roads are empty. In the middle of the trip, Dr. Abel also gets out of the van to move two vehicles that are blocking the way.

Gurbir tells Godbole that a group of people on a special journey will be on the same road as them. Godbole needs to make sure he gets across the road before the group gets there. But Aslam talks to the person in charge of the group and makes them wait until Godbole's car passes. Then, Abel gets in the car with Aslam's help, and Rajeev is able to catch up and get in too after running for a long time. Godbole drives really fast to get them to the hospital on time, and it takes them about two hours to complete the difficult task.

Abel finds out that Shwetha is alive and doesn't blame him for the accident, so he is no longer in trouble. Rehan's parents invite Aditi to their home to show that they accept her. Ria wakes up and her family is very happy. Gurbir feels good and calls Dr. Simon D'Souza to say thank you. Godbole sees some people fighting after a small accident and tells them to stop. The movie ends happily.","['Adventure', 'Drama', 'Thriller']",An emotional thriller based on a road trip from Mumbai to Pune.

9054970,Doctor G,Comedy Drama tion lly hospit fem doctor sks inst Tinder lso gyn colle gues lls friend,Comedy Drama department finds confusion lone male resident chaos comedy eventually great classmates reluctance leads camaraderie fellow,"Dr. Uday Gupta is a medical student who has just passed his final M.B.B.S exam. He lives in Bhopal with his widowed mother Shobha, an aspiring chef who hopes to make it big on social media through her cookery channels, and his best friend, Chaddi, who is preparing for the civil services examination. Uday wants to pursue his post-graduation in orthopaedics, inspired by his distant cousin Dr. Ashok Gupta. His rank in the competitive entrance test, however, is insufficient for an orthopaedics course in Bhopal. Unwilling to leave his mother behind and move to another city for his studies, Uday reluctantly opts for the best available option in Bhopal—gynaecology. Ashok also advises Uday to take this opportunity; Uday can simultaneously continue to study for next year's entrance test. Uday is introduced to Kavya Sharma, a high school student who also aspires to become a doctor and whom Ashok is infatuated with.

Uday's initiation into Gynaecology starts on a bad note—he is instantly ticked off by the head of the department, the strict Dr. Nandini Srivastav, for joining the course 10 days late, and he gets bullied by his colleagues, all of whom are female. Uday blames his ex-girlfriend Ruchi for his present state and, egged on by Ashok, drunkenly calls her and vents his frustrations. His lack of interest at work and his mistakes irritate Nandini, who asks Uday why he doesn't want to become a gynaecologist. Uday replies that male gynaecologists tend not to do well because patients prefer a female doctor examining them. Nandini rubbishes this and asks him to lose his ""male touch"". Following this, Uday gradually befriends his colleagues, especially his senior, Dr. Fatima Siddiqui. Eventually, he falls for her and the two share a passionate kiss, although Fatima dismisses the act as nothing serious, reminding a disappointed Uday that while he is a good friend, she is set to marry the man she loves, Aarif. She also invites him to their engagement.

On a day the hospital is understaffed, Uday tries to examine a female patient without a female attendant, an act considered unethical. A fight breaks out and the patient and her husband later formally complain against him. While facing a disciplinary enquiry, Uday performs his first delivery in the hospital, a case of precipitate labour. The grateful family, who had lost two pregnancies before, name the baby after him. Uday finally understands his duty as a doctor towards his patients. At the enquiry, testimonies of Uday's colleagues clear his name. Nandini, though, remains unimpressed.

Uday tries to confess his love to Fatima at a dinner date, but Shobha's entry complicates things and Fatima storms off. Meanwhile, Ashok has got Kavya pregnant and needs to get an abortion. A prominent doctor and married with two children, Ashok cannot go with Kavya to a hospital himself, so he asks Uday to take her. Check-ups reveal that Kavya has placenta praevia, making abortion difficult. Nandini refuses when Uday requests her to perform the operation herself, stating that it might threaten Kavya's life and thus her family should be informed first. Ashok asks Uday to keep Kavya at his home for the time being, and the two bond well. Kavya tells him that she had first doubted Ashok's character the day he had encouraged Uday to call and rant against Ruchi; Uday feels ashamed of his past behaviour.

On the day of the engagement, Ashok calls Uday and tells him to take Kavya to his clinic, because he has ""come up with a solution"". Arriving home, Uday is shocked to find Shobha partying with an elderly stranger, who turns out to be her Tinder date. Infuriated, Uday orders both the old man and Chaddi—who had helped Shobha get on Tinder in the first place—out of the house. When Uday claims that he has made sacrifices for her sake, Shobha snaps back, relating the difficulties she had raising him as a single mother. Now that her son has grown up, she now desires companionship. Mother and son then make peace.

Soon, Uday receives a call from Kavya—she is in intense pain after receiving an injection at a private clinic. He and Shobha rescue her and rush her to the hospital, where Nandini performs an emergency operation and saves her life. Ashok arrives at the hospital and confronts Uday, but he hits back. Since Kavya is a minor and below the age of consent, the matter is turned over to the police, who arrest Ashok for statutory rape. Uday again has to face an enquiry, and possible rustication, for lying to Nandini about Kavya's age earlier. Nandini, however, sees that Uday is now a changed man, and decides against punishing him. An overjoyed Uday rushes to Fatima's engagement, and proposes to remain her true friend forever.","['Comedy', 'Drama']","Uday Gupta finds himself as the lone male resident in the Gynaecology department.

The movie then goes 9 months back.

In 1971, Shrikant Rai, the Chief of the RAW recruits Rehamatullah Ali a.k.a. Romeo, a banker, after he manages to foil a bank robbery staged by the RAW agents to test his skills for espionage in Pakistan. After training in combat and covert communication techniques, he departs to Pakistan.

In Pakistan, he becomes Akbar Malik, and in his operations is helped by Joker and Mudassar, Pakistani locals helping RAW. Planned circumstances bring him closer to the target Isaq Afridi , whose trust in him strengthens when Akbar not only assures him of his hatred towards India but also saves him from an attack conducted by the henchmen of Nawab Afridi. Akbar informs RAW about a planned attack on Badlipur that would claim innocent lives, both in India and East Pakistan. However, relations between Afridi and Akbar also intensify, due to which he refuses to betray him when Nawab approaches him with an offer to work for him. However, while leaving the rendezvous, Nawab forgets an envelope and asks Akbar to deliver it to the described room number. He is surprised to find his girlfriend Shraddha Sharma there and exclaims ""You?"" in disbelief. She gestures him to keep quiet and opens up a telephone receiver to show a spy transmitter inside it, proving that her room was bugged. She reveals that she, too was working for the RAW and was sent there because Akbar wanted someone close to be sent for him.

In the meanwhile, Colonel Khan's suspicion grows on Akbar, whom he arrests, interrogates, and tortures when he isn't able to extract any information. He is forced to free due to Akbar being Afridi's right hand. However, Akbar's cover soon gets blown, resulting in a chase between him and the colonel. Akbar manages to escape and arrives at home to find Mudassar telling him to escape. Akbar explains that there's no way to escape, due to which Mudassar agrees and goes to prepare tea for him. While waiting, Akbar suspects someone's presence. Hearing a gun clock, he takes out the gun given to him by Mudassar for emergencies, and shoots the person, only to realise it was no one else but Mudassar. Weeping but also remembering the latter's words warning him not to get entangled in relations, he escapes from the scene and the next day, disguised as an army captain, contacts Shrikant for help. The latter declines, telling him that he's not acting like an Indian any more. In the meanwhile, Shraddha and some other RAW agents are arrested while Joker commits suicide. Akbar then meets the army officer who interrogated him and his senior, revealing the truth. He decides to conduct the attacks on Badlipur himself as a form of revenge on the RAW. Accompanied by colonel Khan to avoid any sort of double-crossing, Akbar shocks him by bombing the entire village in a series of explosions, thus confirming his loyalty to Pakistan.

As a result, the Indo-Pakistani War breaks out. Akbar, now a Pakistani officer called Walter Khan, meets Shrikant and Awasthi in Nepal after 10 years. He departs after exchanging a few words and congratulating Awasthi for his impending promotion, leaving the latter surprised. Shrikant then reveals that Walter's still working undercover for India and how the latter's siding with Pakistan was all part of the plan. The bombing didn't cause any deaths as the villagers, as under the pretext of warning about bad weather conditions, they were moved out 24 hours before it took place. Shrikant also reveals Walter's loyalty towards work was the only reason he couldn't turn up even at his mother's funeral. The film ends with a shot of Walter saluting the Indian flag with tears in his eyes.","['Action', 'Drama', 'Thriller']","Prior to the India-Pakistan war of 1971, an Indian banker is recruited by the Research and Analysis Wing for a covert operation deep inside Pakistan.","IB 71,Attack,Pathaan,Modi Ji Ki Beti,Mission Majnu,Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai"

Now can it not be fairly put to you that you are contributing in a way to the exodus of the refugees by your support for the Pakistan guerillas who are operating in East Pakistan—Pakistan army takes reprisals against them, against villages which harbour the guerilla fighters and that causes the exodus, or is at least in part responsible for it. Now must not you, in effect, face the question of having to reduce your support for the guerilla armies operating in East Pakistan?""

The Prime Minister replies ""Does that mean we allow a massacre to continue? What happened first? How many people were killed according to your correspondents of British newspapers, of American newspapers, of French newspapers, Canadian newspapers, Arabian newspapers? The massacre began long before there was a single guerilla.""

Present day: In a college campus, a young man on stage tells a crowd of students ""first we are Bangladeshi. Then, a Bengali. And lastly, a Muslim.""

26 March 1971: Bangladeshi leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman makes the Proclamation of Bangladeshi Independence the radio, ""This may be my last message, from today Bangladesh is independent. I call upon the people of Bangladesh wherever you might be and with whatever you have, to resist the army of occupation to the last. Your fight must go on until the last soldier of Pakistan's occupation army is expelled from the soil of Bangladesh and final victory is achieved.""

The next day, a journalist, Amir  and his wife, Fida  are in bed, when Pakistan Army personnel break open the door and enter. The officer, Malik  shoots the maid who tries to stop them, after which his soldiers beat up Amir and he rapes Fida.

Fida is abducted by the Pakistan Army men and brought in a truck to a prison camp along with a number of other women. In the camp, the women are beaten and forced to take off their clothes. They are then separated into two groups based on age. The older women are lined up and shot, while the younger women are taken to a large shed that serves as their living quarters.

Later, the Pakistani officer Malik explains to his men why the women have been brought there. ""These women have been brought here to serve the nation . The children who will be born from their wombs will be theirs as well as ours. They will be the children of Pakistan. All these women's job is to give birth to children. And if possible, more than one. And those who cannot, have no need to live. This way, we will wipe out the bloodline of the Bengalis.""

A few days later, Amir has survived and is recuperating. His colleagues come to visit him and inform him that many journalists have been killed. They decide to do whatever is needed to report on the atrocities by the Pakistan Army so that the world hears of it. Amir tells them he knows what to do and calls Archer Blood, the American Consul General to Dhaka and takes an appointment with him. When he is travelling to meet Archer, the bus he is travelling in is intercepted by the Pakistan Army, and all the men are killed, while the women are abducted. Amir manages to escape undetected.

In the meanwhile, a young woman Kausar  and her brother Rafiq  are playing in the forest. As they wander around, they chance upon a village which has been the site of a massacre with many dead bodies.

That night, a convoy of refugees fleeing the Pakistanis come to the village where Kausar and Rafiq are staying. At first, Rafiq refuses to allow them into the village, but Kausar tells them they are welcome and apologises for Rafiq. Baba , the leader of the convoy tells them they are moving towards the Indian border where they will be safe. That night, one of the women in the refugee convoy gives birth to a baby, and Kausar offers sweets to the refugees. There are celebrations in the group that night. The next day, the refugee convoy along with Kausar and Rafiq leaves the village, proceeding on their journey towards India.

Amir manages to reach the house of Archer Blood, and tells him about the atrocities of the Pakistan Army. The Consul General promises to raise it with the American government and bring pressure on the Pakistanis to stop their atrocities.

The next day, the refugee convoy is attacked by the Pakistani Army and a number of people are killed. Rafiq sees a Pakistani soldier trying to rape his sister and attacks him. He manages to take his revolver and shoots him. Rafiq and Kausar survive.

Amir then meets Mujeed , a rich man who is organising a resistance movement. Mujeed's men capture a Razakar  who he had helped in the past and had later joined the Pakistanis in killing innocent people. When Majeed asks him why he is committing these atrocities, he replies, ""it was you who enrolled me in the madrasa. I'm just doing what I was taught in the madrasa.""

Amir joins Majeed's men and they start guerrilla attacks on Pakistani soldiers. A few days later, they intercept an army vehicle and take the Pakistani officer Malik as prisoner. Malik is held as a prisoner and Majeed tells him that the Mukti Bahini and the Indian Army have won and asks him to tell his men to surrender. But instead, Malik laughs and taunts Amir about how he raped his wife. In anger, Amir shoots Malik dead.

Kausar and Rafiq reach the Indian border and head towards it across a river. But they are spotted by some Pakistani soldiers, and Rafiq is shot.

That same night, the rebels including Amir raid the camp where Fida and other women are being held captive and release the women. When Amir finds Fida and sees she's heavily pregnant, she starts to walk away, expecting he will reject her. But he takes her hand and holds her back.

Present day: The young man exhorts the people to unite and identify the razakars who are still living in their midst, and bring them to justice.","['Drama', 'History', 'War']",Would you go to war for peace?

The Vishwakarma family claim that Gopi's marriage with Asha was a sham and was just part of a film shooting. It has led to a long running legal dispute between the two families over ownership of the bungalow. Asha has been pretending to be paralyzed in order to gain sympathy and move the case in their favour.Govinda thinks of killing Gauri and takes a gun from Inspector Javed, an old friend of Gopi's, but he cannot muster the courage to kill her.

Later, Michael learns that his friend and co-worker Victor has been brutally murdered.

At the crime scene, Michael meets Agashe and the two are instantly at odds with each other: Agashe wants to kill the murderer, while Michael wants the murderer to be imprisoned. It is implied that Advait is behind Victor's death. Advait soon kills Michael's colleagues Nitin and Deven, where Michael becomes suspicious of a drug-addicted prostitute named Jessie, who is Advait's friend and has been helping him with the murders.

15567704,Salaam Venky,Drama mother boy death life donate organs story predicted live disease doctors case true young suffered,Drama mother smile ideal battled challenging situations face,"Salaam Venky is the true story of Kolavennu Venkatesh, a young boy who suffered from Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, a rare form of dystrophy that will bring him to death. He died in 2004, and his death sparked a national debate about euthanasia in India.

The film follows the story of terminally-ill Venkatesh Krishnan aka Venky  who suffers from degenerative disease DMD , and of his mother Sujata Prasad  who is not ready to give up on him just yet. While doctors predicted that Venky won't live past the age of 16, he continues to challenge medical science at 24, courtesy his own zeal and zest to live, and his mother's determination to keep him alive. 

The boy was forced into a wheelchair since he was six years old. His mother, K Sujatha, cared for him for his whole life. He became a chess player, making it a relevant thing that gave purpose to his life. But when the disease degenerated, in December 2004, the boy was hospitalized in his city, Hyderabad, and the doctors predicted that he will last only 24 to 48 hours. He spent that time on life support.

K.Venkatesh has always been very clear about his situation: his strongest wish was to donate his organs before death will prevent this possibility. For this reason, his mother made an official request to Andhra Pradesh High Court, asking for permission for euthanasia. If the request were accepted, Venkatesh would have been able to donate his organs.

The High Court refused permission for euthanasia. The boy’s mother appealed the decision to India’s Supreme Court, but it was too late. The boy died on December 18, 2004, while his organs were already in the process of disintegrating. He was able to donate only his eyes.

The case of K. Venkatesh sparked the debate about euthanasia in India, as this article from those days proves. Euthanasia has always been a very delicate topic, with many cases worldwide that triggered the question of whether it should be allowed or not .

15314640,Cobalt Blue,Drama Romance guest paying blue Cobalt movie siblings room absolute time family belong traditional migrant important leave home disappearance,Drama Romance family man ensuing traditional brother sister fall love events shatter Based,"Tanay and Anuja belong to a traditional Maharashtrian Brahmin family from Pune. The siblings are inexplicably drawn to a paying guest who lives in the room that once belonged to their grandparents. Although the paying guest’s past is partially revealed, he remains anonymous and inscrutable till the very end. That only reinforces his status as a projection of the siblings’ fantasies of absolute identity and freedom from the ritual ties of kinship.

The movie unfolds in the present, going on until the siblings decide to leave their home following the paying guest’s sudden disappearance. It is set in 1990s Cochin, making the question of what it means to be a migrant apparent. Cochin has been an important destination for many travellers and migrant trading and religious communities. The Marathi Brahmin family in the movie migrate to Kerala where the patriarch sets up his lucrative spice business. The movie draws an important equation between queerness and migration, where the queer subject is always on the move as she negotiates stigma and persecution. Tanay and Anuja do not conform to gender roles: Tanay is an unconventional man and poet who spends most of his time indoors and Anuja is a masculine woman who plays hockey. They leave behind their childhood in Pune to adopt a new culture in Cochin, only to move out of their patriarchal and heteronormative home to create their own futures.

Cobalt blue, the eponymous colour, acquires rich connotations in the movie. The paying guest dips his palm in cobalt blue paint and imprints his presence on the wall of his room. Later we see him painting a wall cobalt blue when Tanay comes in search of him, but he wants to be left alone, to Tanay’s disappointment. There is a beaker of cobalt blue water on a table that sways violently to the rhythms of Tanay and the paying guest’s lovemaking. The night before Anuja ‘elopes’ with the paying guest, Tanay has a dream where the paying guest smears cobalt blue paint on his neck, which makes Tanay embody the paying guest’s absent presence. As the paying guest’s room is being washed and cleaned following his disappearance, Tanay and Anuja notice cobalt blue water streaming down the staircase, when Tanay recites a poem that captures the absolute freedom that the paying guest embodies which comes with letting go of everything and everyone.

It is the paying guest’s utter disregard for social conventions and his apparent self-sufficiency, which is a function of his absolute engagement with whatever he does , that draws the siblings to him. He remains a caring but detached recipient of their affections without expecting anything. The fact that he is an anonymous and deracinated orphan only reinforces his status as an irreducible other who validates and undermines Tanay’s  sense of self. Cobalt blue thus connotes the dialectic between intimacy, loss and estrangement that characterises the relationships in the movie and indeed all relationships.","['Drama', 'Romance']","When a brother and sister fall in love with the same man, ensuing events shatter a traditional Marathi family.

12393526,Bulbbul,Drama Horror Mystery chudail Presidency time village killed ORDIN bro man feet back returns story toge discuss,Drama Horror Mystery abandoned deaths man returns home find brother child bride grown ancestral village plagued mysterious,"The story starts in the nineteenth century in a village in Bengal Presidency. Bulbbul is married off to Indranil, the Bado Thakur , when she is barely five years old. She is close with Satya, Indranil's youngest brother, who is closer to her age. Bulbbul and Satya grow up together, playing and telling each other stories of a demon woman . Indranil's mentally challenged twin brother Mahendra shows a strange appeal toward Bulbbul.

Twenty years later, Satya returns home from London. In the interim Mahendra was killed in what was believed to be a chudail's attack. His widow Binodini now lives in an outhouse. Indranil has left the village and Bulbbul has taken over his responsibilities. The village doctor, Sudip, regularly visits to check Bulbbul's feet due to an undisclosed incident Bulbbul refuses to discuss. Their closeness raises doubts in Satya about Sudip and Bulbbul's relation. While on a hunt, a man is killed; the incident is attributed to the chudail. Satya, however, suspects Sudip. Meanwhile, Bulbbul is informed by a village boy, whose family previously visited the estate to discuss the matter of his father’s second marriage, that his mother had committed suicide after her husband chose his second wife over her, causing Bulbbul to seek the man out.

In flashbacks, it is revealed that Binodini had been jealous of Indranil and Bulbbul's marriage, and had repeatedly hinted to Indranil that Bulbbul had feelings for Satya. With his mind poisoned, Indranil sends Satya to London to separate those two. Bulbbul and Satya had been working so far on a story together, the manuscript of which Satya hands over to her before leaving for London. Heartbroken, she throws the manuscript into the fireplace and lights them up. At this time, influenced by Binodini, Indranil goes to Bulbbul's room, happens to take out some of the burning pages. Upon reading them, he becomes positively convinced of Bulbbul's feelings for Satya. Enraged, he beats and mutilate her feet with iron bars. On top of that, while she is bedridden, Mahendra rapes her, accidentally suffocating her while caught up in his sadism. However, following this, there is a supernatural change in Bulbbul — she comes back with a mission to help the women in the village fight back against injustice. She goes through a symbolic transformation each time, represented by a blood red moon, which indicates that the goddess Kali had given her a chance to return to fight back. She begins to punish the men who abuse and murder their wives or take advantage of other girls by killing them though the villagers think those as doings of the chudail, who is distinguished by her backward feet. It is also revealed that she killed Mahendra following this transformation as punishment for raping her.

At present time, Satya is seen to escort Sudip to Calcutta on the suspicion of being the murderer. On the way, the driver of the carriage  is killed by the chudail, making Satya realize that Sudip is innocent. He shoots the chudail woman, mortally wounding her. As he escapes the carriage, Sudip finds Bulbbul, realizing and accepting her as the chudail. During a brawl with Sudip, Satya unintentionally sets the forest on fire. He realises that Bulbbul is the chudail when Sudip shouts for her. Upon realizing this, Satya cries in agony, while Bulbbul who was trying to escape, takes refuge on a tree and watches everything around her burn before she is slowly engulfed by the flames.

A year later, Indranil returns to his empty estate. He discovers that Satya has departed, as he, guilt-ridden for what had happened with Bulbbul, had felt that he too was becoming like his brothers. That night, Indranil is awoken from his sleep by Bulbbul, who emerges from embers and smirks at him, hinting that she will kill him as revenge.","['Drama', 'Horror', 'Mystery']","A man returns home after years to find his brother's child bride now grown up and abandoned, and his ancestral village plagued by mysterious deaths.","Action Replayy,1920 London,Brij Mohan Amar Rahe,Housefull 4,1920: Evil Returns,Doordarshan"
13919802,Anek,Action Drama Sport Thriller group police people man peace wanted men militant arms believed accord government village knew started dead,Action Drama Sport Thriller political action socio thriller set geopolitical backdrop,"Aman  is an undercover agent who currently resides in North-East India  under the pseudonym Joshua. His mission was to bring peace in the form of control. The Central Government wanted to end the war by signing a peace accord with the prominent militant group, Tiger Sanga ). The idea was to allow Tiger Sanga to run the state government provided they continued to abide by the Indian constitution. While the remaining militant groups had agreed to support the Tiger Sanga, there was another militant group on the rise, who was known by the name Johnson. Johnson was created by the Indian government to pressurize Tiger Sanga to sign the peace accord. They used an old picture of an ex-Tiger Sanga member, Rongmo, to promote the rebel organization. The rise of another militant group meant that it would jeopardize Tiger Sanga's position as the sole voice of the people of the North-East. As a result, they would be forced to agree to what the Indian government offered to retain their position and control.Even though Johnson was created by the Indian government, there was a group that started to function under the same name. They were against signing the peace accord and believed that the Tiger Sanga was betraying their people by agreeing to the conditions of the Central Government. Their purpose was to strengthen their economy by supporting local businesses. They believed that economic independence would be one way to demand a separate nation successfully. They also felt that education was important, as it is only through education that they could put forward their demand and explain their situation. They did not believe in violence, but if they had to take up arms for their cause, they were prepared to do so. The common people started supporting the ""I am with Johnson"" group, and many worked for the cause. The group was headed by a man mysterious man, but Joshua dealt with a man named Doko. Doko asks Joshua to supply arms to their group in exchange for drugs, that he claims he stole from Tiger Sanga.
Aman's superior, Abrar Butt , asked him to hunt down the new militant group before signing the peace accord. What they assumed would help bring Tiger Sanga under control was now another real problem they had to deal with.Amidst it all, there was Aido . A young boxer who dreamed of representing India. Upon arriving in New Delhi, she was on the receiving end of endless racist remarks , but she continued to believe that it was through her sport that she could represent her people. She wanted to bring India's attention to the North East, and for that, she worked incredibly hard. Aman met Aido in her village, and they became friends and were romantically into each other. For Aman, befriending Aido was a part of his job, whereas Aido knew Aman as Joshua and was unaware of his association with the Indian government.Joshua was the owner of a local cafe. He lived a regular life with the locals, and behind closed doors, he discussed the operation he was assigned to. Emma was an employee at the cafe; she knew the whole truth and believed that with the interference of the government, there would be peace in the hills. She feared for her son, Niko , a young boy who lived in the village and whose friends were part of the Johnson militant group. Niko used to provide food to his friends, though he did not take up arms. Emma wanted Joshua to save Niko, in case he ever got into trouble with the local police, due to his association with Johnson.
Even though Niko tried to not get involved in the struggle, he could not help but notice the harm that was caused due to the conflict between the police and the rebels. He saw the police burn paddy fields, a source of income for the villagers, in an attempt to force the villagers to confess the whereabouts of Horen, the group leader.Niko was arrested by the police since he wore the same cap as the militant group. He was stripped down and tied to bamboo shoots. The police had arrested nearly every youth and brutally tortured them to learn more about Johnson. Emma reached out to Aman for help, and he drove to the station to help Niko. After saving him from the brutality, Emma advised Niko to go to Delhi for a safe future, but he disagreed. He loved his village and wanted to live there and farm. He did not wish for luxury; he simply wanted to live an ordinary life in his village. After returning to his village, Niko started helping his friends who were being hunted by Tiger Sanga's men. Tiger Sanga knew that the Indian Govt is propping up the Johnson group and deploys his own army to destroy the Johnson army.
The group was a target of both the police  and the Tiger Sanga, and it was becoming difficult for them to survive. The members of the group were mostly young kids who took up arms to fight for what their parents had once believed in. During an encounter with the Tiger Sanga men, Niko lost his cousin. That was the day he took up arms and shot a man dead. It was the pain of watching his brother die that forced him to choose the path of violence.When Niko's group was about to take arms that were delivered by Johnson's men but were also tracked by the police, they were all shot dead. Aman had tried to stop the police from encountering those kids, but Abrar Butt refused to listen to his request. He was instructed to maintain silence in the hills, and to do that he could go to any extent. Aman says that Abrar has accepted the violence from Tiger Sanga, since he is willing to the toe the line of Govt of India, but Johnson represents the voice of the people. Aman wants Abrar to talk to the Johnson group as well.
Aman conflicted with himself; he believed that they were also, in a way, responsible for bringing in the arms to the villages, worsening the living condition of the local people there. He was confused about whether he was supposed to protect India or the Indians. He was in charge of bringing peace, but it came at the cost of severe violence.
Abrar thinks Aman is conflicted due to Aido. Abrar puts Aman under 24*7 watch.While Aido was determined to be selected to represent India, her father, Wangnao, did not believe that his people belonged to the nation and he was fighting for their cause. Aman was surprised when Dido, Wangnao's close associate, asked him for guns in exchange for drugs. They stole the drugs from Tiger Sanga and wanted to use them to their benefit. This alerted Aman that the Johnson group was preparing to fight the police and the Tiger Sanga men on the day the peace accord would be signed. Aman had befriended Aido to get information about her father, but in the process, he had fallen in love with her. Wangnao and his group did not know that Aman was a police officer; they thought he was a businessman who was interested in investing in their war. When Tiger Sanga's men started to look for the Johnson group , Wangnao escaped from his house. Aido had her qualifying match, but her father announced that he had his match to win and left. Aman came to their house to drive Aido to the airport, and at that moment, he tried to sneak around to collect information about him. Aido caught Aman taking pictures of her father's documents and questioned his identity. He revealed that he was not Joshua, the man she assumed him to be. But he added that his feelings for her were not false, but Aido had by then lost her respect for him and asked him to leave.Aman had gathered information regarding Wangnao's current location and went ahead to confront him . He discussed how he was not Joshua but a police officer. Wangnao was shocked upon learning the truth. He then explained that Johnson was not one man but every north-eastern people who believed in fighting against those who tried to control them. The north-eastern people have always been discriminated against by the rest of India. He stated that the northeast's only connection to the rest of India was through a small piece of land in West Bengal. When that route remained blocked, the north-eastern states suffered immensely. The conflict made the poor miserable, and the rich thrived as a result. To earn money, people there indulged in the business of drugs and arms. Tiger Sanga men were involved in the drug business and corrupted the youth. He believed that by now, both the State and the Tiger Sanga have realized that it is easier to maintain war than peace, and it results in a never-ending conflict. His conversation with Wangnao left him thinking about what it meant to be an Indian.While Aman intended to capture Wangnao and try him in court, his senior wanted the man dead. A group of policemen had followed Aman and started to shoot Wangnao and his men. Aman escaped from the situation, but he was mad at Abrar Bhatt, whose order had escalated the situation. Aman knew that Abrar had tracked the location where he had delivered arms to Doko and his men. They were ambushed by Abrar's forces & killed.Abrar contacted Aman once again to find out Wangnao's location. Aman knew that the man was hiding in Myanmar, and they had to conduct a surgical strike to bring the man to the country. Abrar assigned Major Veer to the mission to help Aman. While the soldiers wanted to shoot the man dead, Aman advised against it. He stated that he believed in the constitution of India, and he wanted the man to be tried in court. Upon reaching Myanmar, they found that another militant group had reached the spot and were shooting at Johnson's men. After both the people from the militant groups were shot dead, Aman proceeded to capture Wangnao. Wangnao dropped his gun and surrendered. Meanwhile, Aido had qualified for the final and fought against a German boxer.Aman met Abrar Bhatt in New Delhi and brought him the files of Wangnao's crimes and also the crime record of Tiger Sanga. He believed that if Wangnao was to be tried in court, then Tiger Sanga must be arrested as well. And if they intend to negotiate with Tiger Sanga, then they must also do the same with Wangnao. Abrar agreed with Aman's belief, and he informed the media about the cancellation of the peace accord after compelling evidence of crimes was found against Tiger Sanga. The two, in the end, watch Aido's winning match at a club, stating how it was she who had won in this game of chess.","['Action', 'Drama', 'Sport', 'Thriller']","A socio political, action thriller set against the geopolitical backdrop of Northeast India.","Pathaan,Mission Majnu,Satyameva Jayate 2,Lost,Attack,Paltan"

9248972,Mission Mangal,Drama History team Director Dhawan Vidya Balan satellite mission make payload wife budget expert,Drama History ISRO Based successfully launching making true events expensive mission,"Across the landscapes of Bengaluru, at ISRO, after the failed launch of GSLV-F06 on 25 December 2010, due to a miscalculation by Project Director Tara Shinde , Rakesh Dhawan , a fellow scientist working with her, takes the blame for the mistake. As a result, he is relocated to work on Mangalyaan  as punishment, where Tara joins him out of guilt. The new GSLV missions are given to Rupert Desai, a NASA scientist of Indian origin. The Mars Orbiter Mission  is thought of as an impossible mission by his coworkers due to its aim of reaching Mars with its tight budget.

Rakesh learns that the MOM cannot take off on the PSLV since the available technology has a payload of only 1500 kg and not enough fuel to fire the rocket to be carried to a distance of almost 55 million kilometres. GSLV, if it had succeeded, could have taken the satellite to Mars as it had a payload of 2300 kg. However, recent significant failures of GSLV have jeopardised the planned future missions.

Tara is also caught up at home between constant feuds between her husband Sunil and her son Dilip, the latter showing an interest in his namesake A. R. Rahman and Islam. Dilip has another interest in the Mars Mission. One day when Tara has to make pooris and runs out of gas, she plans to cook the rest with the flame off. This sparks an idea on using minimal fuel on the PSLV vehicle, to reach Mars. With reluctance, opposing NASA scientist Rupert Desai  assigns a junior team to Rakesh and Tara.

The junior scientists' team comprises: Eka Gandhi - a propulsion control expert, who is looking for any chance to get away to NASA; Neha Siddiqui - a spacecraft autonomy designer, who is struggling with rejection as a result of her intercommunal background despite her divorce; Kritika Aggarwal - a navigation expert who is also a devoted wife to her army husband Rishi , while trying hard to get a driving license; Varsha Pillai - the satellite designer and payload expert, who faces her mother-in-law's taunts for being unable to conceive a child; Parmeshwar Joshi - the payload expert, who relies more on the religious priest and his advice but subsequently develops a romantic interest in Eka; and Ananth Iyengar - the team's structural engineer, who is trying to complete his pilgrimage to Tirumala with his wife.

After the announcement of India's second Moon mission, Chandrayaan-2, the mission's budget is cut by 50%; in between the tight schedule and minuscule budget, Tara and Rakesh continue to work on their MOM project by making several compromises, even as Kritika abruptly abandons her duties without informing the duo upon learning that Rishi has been severely wounded in action. Tara and Rakesh realise that the rest of the junior scientists working on the project have low morale and motivation to make this mission happen, leading to the team slowing down. Tara soon realises that in order to meet their budget and schedule, she must make the team members change their attitudes, and motivate them to make their dream jobs into a reality. An attempt on her part to pacify her worried husband, Sunil by tracing their daughter Anya, who hasn't arrived home yet, to a club, eventually culminates in Sunil warming up to the party environment as he throws a comment about nostalgia. This strikes an idea in Tara's head, and the next day, she successfully motivates the team members by reminding them of their childhood passion for science, and they put all their hardwork and energy into resolving the issues with the mission to make it happen. Meanwhile, even as Kritika returns on being reminded by Rishi that she has a duty towards her country too, just like him, Varsha happens to be pregnant and soon delivers a child, for whom the team makes arrangements at the office itself, while Neha is warmly taken in by Ananth and his wife into their house .

The MOM satellite is finally launched on PSLV on 5 November 2013 , and is named Mangalyaan  and is successfully inserted into Earth's orbit. Rakesh and his team celebrate the successful launch. However, while doing the sixth orbit-raising manoeuvre, the jets fail to launch, pushing the mission 6 days behind. Rupert mocks the team, while Tara continues to keep hope that something will happen. Couple months later, on the way to Mars, the satellite is hit by a solar radiation wave, heavily damaging the communication systems of the satellite. When the team manages to regain communications, they realise that the solar radiation had increased the speed of the satellite and pushed it further, making up the 6 day gap they had incurred while doing the orbital manoeuvres with Earth. After spending a 298-day transit to Mars, MOM satellite is inserted into Mars orbit on 24 September 2014, making India the 4th country in the world to do so and the first country to do it in the first attempt.","['Drama', 'History']","Based on true events of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) successfully launching the Mars Orbiter Mission (Mangalyaan), making it the least expensive mission to Mars.","Rocketry: The Nambi Effect,Pathaan,PK,Runway 34,Joker,Parmanu: The Story of Pokhran"
13723562,420 IPC,Crime MMRD case cheques client home office find police judge footage RDIN back court loan heads,Crime Original film forgery arrested bank fraud hires lawyer case realises eye fight meets,"Bansi Keswani  is a chartered accountant who handles the family accounts and income tax returns for his client, Sandesh Bhonsale, the deputy director for the MMRDA .

After a routine meeting, Bansi heads home, but as soon as he leaves Mr Bhonsale is visited by the CBI at his office. Bansi reaches home where his wife, Pooja , informs him that the bank collectors arrived again since Bansi hasn’t been able to pay the instalments for his home loan.The CBI officers soon arrive at Bansi’s house and despite protests from the occupants of the house, they pull out everything in search of any clues as to whether Bansi is involved. When they do not find anything, they take Bansi back to CBI headquarters for further questioning.

At the headquarters, they inform Bansi that his client has been taken into custody for siphoning off almost 1200 crore in government funds that were meant for the Airoli flyover project. Bansi pleads his innocence, and they go over all of his accounts with a fine-tooth comb to confirm.After a whole day of investigation, Bansi is sent home with a clean chit as they cannot find any evidence against him. He heads back home with his family after this tiring ordeal.

A few months later, Bansi is in the office of another one of his clients, Mr Sinha , who is a builder in the city. In the middle of their meeting, Mr Sinha heads out for a phone call and when he returns Bansi informs him that he is ready to leave.

Soon after he leaves, Mr Sinha takes out his chequebook to write out a particular cheque when he realizes that 3 of his cheques are missing. He locks down the office and calls the police to investigate. They do not find anything in the office, and on checking the guest register, zero in on Bansi as the lead suspect.

The police head over to Bansi’s office and during their search, they find the stolen cheques in one of his folders and written out to him. They immediately arrest him despite his many pleas of innocence.At the police station, Bansi is informed that his request for bail was denied and that he will be sent to judicial custody for the duration of his court case. Bansi tells Pooja that he knows an effective and cheap lawyer whose services they can call on.

Birbal Chaudhary  is tasked with fighting Bansi’s case for him against the seasoned public prosecutor, Sawak Jamshedji  who underestimates his fresh-faced colleague. Jamshedji calls on a forensic expert who confirms that the cheques were forged but Birbal carries out his research to refute the accusation.

Using his analysts and research, Birbal confirms that while the cheques were certainly forged there is no guarantee that it was Bansi who carried out the act of forgery himself. Moreover, he proves that the cheques were written while still attached to the chequebook and then folded for an amount of time before being placed in Bansi’s files.

Birbal uses his contacts in the police to get background checks on Bansi’s family and social circle which eventually leads him to Gulab Mane who provides tiffins to both Bansi and Mr Sinha. Gulab also has a history of theft and robbery in his past which makes him a key suspect.

Birbal manages to establish some motive but uses fake CCTV footage to coerce a confession out of Gulab Mane. He’s close to achieving his goal before Jamshedji points out the fake footage for which he is reprimanded and Gulab’s testimony is not considered valid.Birbal has to go back to square one as Gulab has absconded after his first appearance and even his credibility has taken a hit thanks to his antics.




Pooja asks Birbal whether bribing the judge is an option, putting her desperation on full display. Birbal says that while the judge may be egotistical, he is still an honest judge and a bribe will not solve their problems.

Pooja is then seen visiting Mr. Sinha at his residence. This is caught by the building security cameras and brought to Birbal’s attention. Birbal wants to use this information in court but he’s sure that bringing it up might end up with him losing his client.

Birbal questions Pooja on the stand about the meeting, displaying the security footage in court. Jamshedji brings up Birbal’s history of using doctored footage but Birbal confirms that this time the footage is genuine and can be corroborated by the building security.

While Pooja mentions that she had visited Mr. Sinha to waive off the payment of a loan they had given him, Mr. Sinha claims that Pooja was there to offer her body in exchange for her husband’s freedom. This tactic causes temporary friction between Pooja and Bansi but they make up and agree to let Birbal stay on and work the case despite his insinuations.
Jamshedji puts forward a request for Bansi’s household to be searched for any possible evidence against him in the case with the judge granting the request. When the police look through their belongings, they find a few property documents with Mr. Sinha’s name on them.

These documents are presented in court with the accusations piling on that Bansi had stolen them along with the cheques to falsely put them up for sale and run away with any token advance he might receive. Birbal uses the fact that Mr. Sinha has been in debt for a long while and uses the statement that Bansi had provided to divert the guilt away from his client.

While he does not have any concrete proof, he does manage to sow some doubt in the mind of the judge in favour of his client’s innocence.Birbal is contacted by his friend who works with computers who sends him some hidden data.

When no one in Andhra has the courage to stand up against Pratap Ravi, a man comes into the light to seek revenge on him. Yeturi Suryanarayana Reddy, a.k.a. Surya  is seen waiting in the woods near the main road, waiting for Pratap Ravi and hurls a bomb at his convoy. Unfortunately for Surya, Pratap Ravi escapes the bomb blast. Pratap Ravi's henchmen attempt to kill Surya, but he manages to escape.

Surya informs his wife Bhavani  that he missed the chance of killing Pratap Ravi. Meanwhile, the media asks Pratap Ravi if this attempt is Surya's revenge for the TV bomb placed in Surya's home by Pratap Ravi himself. Pratap Ravi denies the charge. Shivaji Rao  asks Pratap Ravi to stop this vengeance, but the latter insists on killing Surya. Pratap Ravi orders his action team to kill anyone who opposes him. DCP Mohan Prasad  starts to investigate the case. He finds Bhavani and demands Surya to surrender or else he would harm his wife and baby son Arya. Surya thinks that he has missed a great chance and another chance will not come so easily, and so he decides to surrender for protection plots to kill Pratap Ravi. Mohan Prasad produces Surya in court to face his trial. Pratap Ravi sends a henchmen to kill Surya in the court, but Surya manages to fight the henchman and kills him in front of the judge. Surya is sent to prison.

Pratap Ravi decides to kill Surya inside the jail, he plans carefully and decides that someone from outside their camp should accomplish the task so that the police will not suspect them. In prison, Surya befriends Muddu Krishna by telling him his story. The flashback shows that after Pratap Ravi's attempt to kill Narasimha Reddy , Surya's brother wants to take revenge. Surya, on the other hand, does not want to take revenge straight away and tells him to be patient and to leave the matter as it is, as he does not want to put his mother and sister in any danger. Within a few months, Surya's entire family is killed in the TV bomb blast. After hearing the story, Muddu Krishna decides to help Surya kill Ravi. The henchmen in prison try to kill Surya, but Surya fights them back. After this failure, Pratap Ravi is warned by Shivaji Rao. As a result, Pratap Ravi decides that he wants to stop this revenge, and he meets Surya in jail. Pratap Ravi tells Surya to stop this bloodshed, to which Surya promptly replies that he will stop after killing the former. Pratap Ravi thinks he cannot do anything because he is in jail, which makes him defenseless.

Enters Krishnaswamy, the opposition party leader, who decides to meet Surya. He says that to kill Pratap Ravi, Surya has to become a bigger name in Anantapur than Pratap Ravi. Krishnaswamy requests Surya to ask his wife to stand in the election, to which he does. This makes Ravi to fear for his life and also for his ministerial post; consequently, his henchmen want to eliminate Bhavani, but Nandini  pleads with Pratap Ravi not to kill Bhavani, causing Ravi to abort the plan. However, one of Ravi's closest gang members, Umapati, is already on his way to kill Bhavani. Muddu Krishna kills Umapati and saves Bhavani. Krishnaswamy comes to the prison to thank Surya, and Surya thanks him in return.

A scared Pratap organises a meeting involving the leaders of all the districts in Andhra Pradesh. Knowing this, Surya plots to kill Pratap Ravi. He realises that in the meeting, all the leaders will participate with their bodyguards. He orders Muddu Krishna to dress like a bodyguard since no one would be able to identify whose bodyguard belongs to whoever. Using this ambiguity, Surya's henchmen can kill Pratap Ravi. After the meeting comes to an end, Pratap Ravi plans to leave. As he was leaving, he sees a familiar face and is struck. He sees Surya standing in front of him with his handgun. Surya fires at Pratap Ravi until he dies in a pool of blood. Surya's friends put tear gas and create panic, and under the cover of smoke, Surya escapes from the scene and returns to the prison.

Muddu Krishna takes the blame for killing Pratap Ravi for Surya. Mohan Prasad comes to meet Surya in jail and justifies why Pratap Ravi became a factionist: it was the circumstances that made him do so. He tells Surya that the same circumstances will change him into a Ravi. Surya thanks Mohan Prasad but assures him that he will not become a Ravi.

2804026,Aurangzeb,Action Drama Thriller Neen police lso bout kill time tion kills meeting wife bro lly hospit Prithvir Sukum,Action Drama Thriller Kinship Emperor Kingship world bring criminal law,"The story is set in the town of Gurgaon, an industrial city near NCT Delhi. The film is presented from the view of ACP Arya Phogat . Arya, a police officer, has been brought up by his uncle, DCP Ravikant Phogat . His father, police inspector Vijaykant Phogat , had lost interest in life years back, after messing up an operation to kill Yashvardhan Singh , due to lack of evidence against him. Yashvardhan's wife, Veera , had become a police informer against her own husband and had to run away from him with one of her twin children Vishal  while Ajay is left with Yashvardhan. Vijaykant hides Vishal and Veera – whom he has begun to love – and passes it off as a botched encounter for which he takes the entire blame. Suspended from the police force, Vijaykant has a tough time over the years, caught between the love for his real family and son ACP Arya, and his adopted wife and son. Years later, just before he dies, he reveals to Arya that he has another wife and kid but doesn't reveal their real identity. Vijaykant dies a few days later, and Arya goes to meet Veera. There he is shocked to see Vishal, who is the exact replica of Ajay , and there is a revelation that both lookalikes are actually twins.

Ravikant, who is corrupt to the core, hatches a plot to expose the criminal activities of Yashvardhan, a mission left incomplete by his brother Vijaykant. He joins forces with nephew Arya and convinces Vishal to enter Yashvardhan's house, posing as Ajay. To facilitate matters, Ajay is kidnapped by Ravikant and Arya and held captive by them, paving the way for Vishal to take his place and leak information about Yashvardhan's illegal activities to the police. Vishal has to pose as Ajay not just in front of his own father, Yashvardhan, but also in front of Neena Wadhwa , Yashvardhan's paramour and business partner, while also having to feign an affair with his twin brother's girlfriend, Ritu . As days pass, Vishal falls in love with Ritu. One night they strip each other and it is implied they had sex. Vishal keeps leaking information about his dad to Ravikant and Arya, who move forward in their exposé with the help of the incriminating evidence. On the other hand, Ravikant and Arya unite Ajay with mother Veera and also try to brainwash him into spilling the beans about his father's illegal businesses before them.

Over time, Vishal develops a soft corner for his father and pleads for his safety from the police. He also wins the confidence of his father, who is unaware that Vishal has replaced Ajay in the house. Calamity befalls Yashvardhan because of the action initiated by Ravikant, and he has to be hospitalised. Vishal manipulates things in such a way that Neena has to resign from Yashvardhan Singh's company. Even as the tension between Arya and foster-brothers Ajay and Vishal refuses to be diffused, the task before Ravikant and Arya becomes very difficult. To make matters more difficult for Ravikant, his son-in-law, Vishnu , lays his hands on evidence against Ravikant's equally corrupt police officer-son, Inspector Dev . Since Vishnu is the only honest cop in the family, he threatens to expose brother-in-law Dev, and in order to prevent this, Ravikant kills Vishnu. Ravikant also plans to take over Yashvardhan's empire with help from Neena, and orders Arya to kill Veera and Ajay. Arya, disillusioned by Ravikant's inhuman attitude, finally understands the choice his father Vijaykant made earlier to protect Vishal and his mother.

Meanwhile, Vishal is called for a meeting by Neena and her new partner, Bilal. Ravikant wants Vishal to use the meeting to give him more information about Yashvardhan, and plans things in such a way that Yashvardhan would be killed once the meeting between Vishal and Neena is over. Arya realises that Ravikant wants to eliminate Yashvardhan not as much to complete brother Vijaykant's mission as to take over Yashvardhan's business empire. Also, Vishal has revenge written all over him because Neena's son, Inder , had killed Ritu. Here, Ajay finally relents and agrees to help Arya, but he also wants his dad, Yashvardhan's safety. Arya asks Ajay to attend the meeting in place of Vishal. Ajay kills Inder, and when Inder's gang tries to kill Ajay, Arya's police team encounters all. Meanwhile, Arya has sent Vishal to the hospital to save Yashvardhan. He also arranges his police force to raid the hospital. However, Dev sends back the team. He later corners Vishal and Yashvardhan in the hospital store room. Just when Dev was about to kill them, Ajay appears and shoots him. Ajay and Yashvardhan convince Vishal to escape. Just when Vishal escapes, Dev shoots and kills Yashvardhan, but in retaliation, Ajay rises and kills Dev. When Dev's team was about to kill Ajay, Arya's police force rescues him by arresting Ajay. Arya helps Vishal and Veera escape. Ravikant meets Arya, and Arya informs him that he has the recordings of Neena's meeting, which will expose Ravikant. Ravikant shoots Arya, and just when he was about to kill him, Vishal comes back and kills Ravikant.

Arya, even though injured, rides back to his pregnant wife, Suman . Vishal and Veera get back to their earlier life while Ajay is jailed. We also hear a voiceover of Arya saying, ""This system of the collection has been in place for years. The money from this system goes all the way up to the seniors and ministers. The nexus is not going to come to an end with just my uncle's death. The DCP said that only two powers would survive – the politicians and the corporates. But if a policeman doesn't take bribes from any of them, then he won't fear them either."" The film then moves one year forward, where we are shown that Ajay has re-united with Vishal and Veera once he is released from jail. In the final scene, we see Arya leaving Veera's home once he makes sure that Ajay is re-united with his family.","['Action', 'Drama', 'Thriller']","Kingship knows no Kinship and there can be only one Emperor in Aurangzeb's world.

He and the man battle for hardly a moment before he kills him. Before leaving, the murderer is seen destroying any potential clues. Only a fingerprint is left on a flower vase on the balcony.The victim is later revealed to be Akash Sardana the following morning. The inquiry is headed by Shivani Mathur , a young police officer who is perceptive enough to piece together what happened based on clues. Investigators were told by Akash's sister  that he had taken Rs 2 million from the family bank account for his tech start-up, but no such money was found in the locker. Akash had recently returned to India from US, four months ago. He is also recently divorced.A neighbor later tells that the killer was caught in one of his own selfies. A ACP high-ranking police official, Dhiren Yadav  recognizes Arjun Sehgal  as the perpetrator and feels relieved to have his chance at revenge.
To begin, he has Shivani look into Arjun's history from the perspective of the murder. The cops eventually arrest Arjun and provide him with evidence. He gives a flimsy alibi , and the ACP is relieved that the investigation may finally be closed.
It takes 30 minutes home from Arjun's home, but he only returned at 2 am. Arjun says he had a flat tire on the way home. A taxi driver helped him change the tire as his jack was broken and hence it took 3 hours to get it fixed.
Dhrien confronts Arjun with his photo taken when he was at Akash's house.A constable takes into custody a man named Sooraj  for drunken driving and disorderly conduct who looks strikingly similar to Arjun. ACP talks to his attorney friend Bijou , who assures him that the situation is hopeless in court and that they will get bail without any trouble. He can only buy himself two extra days before they have to be presented in court. The authorities now have 48 hours to collect proof. Both Arjun and Sooraj show the same injuries.Arjun, a brilliant engineer, is dating the lovely Janhvi  in a flashback. Arjun has invested his entire net worth in launching a construction project of his own. Jhanvi travels to Mumbai for 2 weeks for her college reunion. Arjun proposes to Janhvi before she leaves.However, Sooraj is a minor criminal who, together with his friend Chaddi , makes a living by perpetrating cons. Sooraj is a criminal, but his legal acumen is on par with that of a top attorney. He saves Chaddi when a victim files a case for selling his 30 fake iPad. Chaddi wants to settle out of court, but the victim is the relative of a policeman and is intent on sending Chaddi to court. Sorraj argues that police found 30 iPad boxes in the raid, and not 30 fake iPad. He claims Chaddi is a scrap paper dealer and as such selling iPad boxes is legal for him. There is no case against Chaddi.
One such mob boss kidnaps Chaddi and holds him for ransom, demanding 2 million as payment for the deception he perpetrated the mob boss.
Sooraj gambles away his last handful money but comes out empty-handed. Sooraj gets drunk and is caught by the police and brought to the police station, in the present day.The DNA found at the crime scene matches both of them, revealing that Arjun and Sooraj are identical twins in the present day, but the evidence acquired by the police is usually deceiving. Only a fingerprint is different for identical twins. The forensic lab sends their own technicians to the crime scene to check for fingerprints. But a constable breaks the vase when he was talking on the phone and unknowingly pushes the vase off the balcony.Arjun and Sooraj come face to face at the police station and start fighting with each other.
The two of them begin relating their tale. Their parents' marriage is failing, and their mother Miss Rana  is seeking solace in gambling, which ultimately leads to the couple's separation and eventual divorce. While Arjun does not have the same strong feelings for his mother as does Sooraj, the reverse is also true. Miss Rana tells Sooraj to always look after Arjun.
Because he is an attorney, the father Ravi  takes away the kids and prevents their mother from seeing them. Because of this, their mother grows depressed and ends up taking her own life. After that point, they go in different directions.
Due to their fights, Ravi admits both of them to a mental institution for a year for treatment. One of them even stabbed a doctor in the neck, but it was never solved who stabbed the doctor.Shivani is confident that Sooraj is the perpetrator due to his criminal record and flimsy alibi.
The old constable tells Shivani that ACP is out for revenge on Arjun because, eight years ago, Arjun helped ACP's daughter elope with her lover and ACP tried to pull all the legal apparatus against Arjun, but his daughter testified in Arjun's favor in court. ACP still doesn't know where his daughter is.
Now Shivani and ACP are trying to frame the other by concealing from each other in order to secure a solid alibi for Arjun and Sooraj.
Shivani finds that Sooraj paid off Rs 2 million to the mob boss, the morning after the murder. It could be the money stolen from Akash's locker. But Sooraj says that he won the money by gambling and gives a solid alibi for the same , which is verified.
Meanwhile Shivani finds that Arjun was with Radhika , the night of the murder and Radhika testifies to the same.Six months later, the court still isn't sure that one of them committed the crime, but they also can't condemn either of them because of their solid alibi.A few weeks later after the verdict, Shivani receives Janhvi's missing person case file. When Shivani does some digging, she finds out from Janhvi's friend that Janhvi went to a class reunion just before she disappeared.
Later that day, Janhvi's friend gets a text from Janhvi saying that she and Arjun are no longer together and that she is getting married instead-to none other than Akash. Because she fabricated Arjun's alibi, she can no longer dispute that the crime was committed for financial gain.After learning of Janhvi's messages, Arjun decided to confront Akash, as revealed by Arjun. After a brief altercation, Arjun coerces Akash into telling the truth about his connection to Janhvi. They were dating in college, but Akash tells him things didn't work out. He approached her at the reunion, but she avoided him. Akash then forces himself upon her in his hotel room after spiking her drink. She overdoses on drugs and dies from sexual assault. Akash then pays 2 million to the police to drop the case. Arjun murders Akash out of rage and then flees the scene.After hearing that Arjun had been arrested for murder, Sooraj told him that he had cleaned up the scene and planted evidence to divert the police's attention from himself. Sooraj knew that the ACP was gunning for Arjun, so Sooraj deliberately got himself arrested.
Sooraj then planted stories to play Shivani. Shivani was so convinced of Arjun's innocence that she manufactured false evidence in form of Radhika and the taxi driver who helped Arjun change the flat tire that night. Arjun never met Radhika that night.
Arjun gives Sooraj the house he's been living in since they split up.","['Action', 'Crime', 'Drama', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']",The murder investigation of a young man takes an unexpected turn when the cops discover that the prime suspect has a lookalike.,"Talvar,Cuttputlli,Singham,Raat Akeli Hai,Murder 2,Saaho"

2215477,Goliyon Ki Rasleela Ram-Leela,Drama Musical Romance Rajadi killed house bro chieftain finger made Singh Ranveer played clans clan Padukone Deepika,Drama Musical Romance twist Modern love lust adaptation film focuses story drama,"In the fictional Gujarati village Ranjhaar, infamous for its uninhibited manufacture and sale of arms and ammunition, two clans—Rajadi and Sanera—have been at odds with each other for the past 500 years. A violent altercation between the two occurs after Bhavani, a Sanera, fires at the son of Meghji Bhai, a Rajadi chieftain. Bhavani is almost killed by Meghji Bhai, but Ram , Meghji Bhai's younger brother, intervenes and saves Bhavani. All the Rajadi elders are irked by Ram being a vagabond who deals in stolen cars, with his mindset of making a truce with the other clan.

During the festival of Holi, Ram boldly enters the house of the Sanera heads and flirts with Leela . Meanwhile, her mother, Dhankor Baa, the chieftan of the Saneras, is busy arranging a match for her daughter with a simple-minded NRI. Leela's elder brother, Kanji Bhai, is angered by Ram's entry into the house and bribes the local police to raid Ram's house. Ram, however, manages to convince the policemen to leave in exchange for a set of his blue films. Ram and Leela develop a romance and plan to elope, but a grim turn of events follows when Kanji accidentally kills Meghji, Ram's brother, and is, in turn, killed by Ram.

To escape the suffering, Ram and Leela elope and marry, but just as they are about to consummate their marriage, Ram's friends trace them and betray him by inebriating him and informing Leela's family of their location. The next morning, Leela is forcibly taken back home by Bhavani, her cousin, while Ram is hailed as a hero by the Rajadis for soiling Leela's reputation. He is rewarded by being made the new chieftain of the Rajadis.

Meanwhile, Dhankor Baa arranges the engagement of Leela and the NRI, much to the chagrin of the pair. Leela refuses, citing that her finger is already occupied by the ring from her marriage to Ram. In her anger, Dhankor Baa chops off Leela's finger. Upon learning of this, Ram does the same to his own finger and visits Leela while she is asleep. Leela still retains faith in Ram and sends Rasila, the widow of Kanji, to give Ram an ultimatum to take her away. Rasila is assaulted by Ram's friends, and when Dhankor Baa learns of this, she sends Bhavani and other men to assault Kesar, Meghji's widow, who manages to evade them.

In response to the attempt on Kesar, Ram storms into Leela's house and incapacitates the guards single-handedly. He then requests Dhankor Baa to consider negotiation for peace, and she invites him to celebrate Navratri with the Saneras, with the intention of having him killed. However, at the event, Bhavani secretly shoots and seriously injures Dhankor Baa to place the blame on the Rajadi. Leela is made the chieftain of the Saneras and gets busy tending to her mother. She bitterly carries out a negotiation with Ram, equally dividing the travel routes and trades, with the condition that the Saneras and Rajadis will not interact with each other ever again.

Bhavani, who does not tolerate this development, deceives Leela into blindly signing a document that orders unrestrained killings of the Rajadis. During Dusshera, as the Ramlila parade is ending, many of the Rajadis are killed, and the village is on the brink of war, which Ram senses. Ram and Leela realise that they are soulmates and shoot one another dead, all the while oblivious to the fact that Dhankor Baa has undergone a change of heart and has killed Bhavani, ordering that peace be made with the other clan. The two clans come together to cremate the bodies of the lovers.","['Drama', 'Musical', 'Romance']","Modern adaptation of William Shakespeare's 'Romeo and Juliet' with an Indian twist, the film focuses on the story of Ram and Leela, their love, lust and the drama afterwards.","Adipurush,Shuddh Desi Romance,Jayantabhai Ki Luv Story,Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi,Teri Meri Kahaani,Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster 3"
14988886,U Turn,Crime Drama Horror Mystery Thriller person U-turn police people man illegal stones accident killing car officer rjun serial killer taking find,Crime Drama Horror Mystery Thriller U-turn Motorists mysteriously illegal flyover die journalist fate interning investigating prime suspect twist,"The movie begins with a man driving along the NTPC flyover in Chandigarh when he is asked to come back to a certain place by the caller on his phone. The man moves the stones meant to be used as dividers on the flyover, takes an illegal U-turn, and drives down the other side of the road, forgetting to put the stones back in their original positions. A car driving by the bridge, unable to see the stones placed right in the middle of the road, crashes because of them. The person in the car immediately dies. A year or two later, Radhika Bakshi, who has joined as an intern with a local newspaper, is working on the story about people not surviving the accidents caused by the stones. These stones are still being moved for the illegal U-turn, and neither the RTO nor the police are doing anything to make sure this is curbed. The mortality rates of such accidents are high, and as a reporter, Radhika needs answers from the authorities and the people who took this illegal turn. She gets in touch with a government official who took that illegal U-turn to learn more about his mindset. We have no idea why Radhika would want to interview people who have committed this act. They will not be in a position to remember anything. The man, though, was found dead by the police the next day. According to the initial reports, the man has committed suicide unless they find some other clues. Since Radhika was the last person to have met up with him as per the residence register, she was brought in for questioning. Radhika is clueless about why she is being dragged to the police station. In her opinion, she was just doing her job as a journalist, which is asking questions.Radhika is asked about how she gets information about the people taking a U-turn. She lets the police know of the beggar on the bridge, who writes down the vehicle number, and gives it to Radhika, who  gets the home address from an RTO officer. As the police investigate all the vehicle numbers that she has gathered, they come to know that all of them have committed suicide, and it cannot be a coincidence. The police team, headed by an officer named Arjun, is trying to find out how suicides in a spree could happen when only Radhika knew of the addresses. Radhika is also clueless and claims to be innocent. She never had any intention of harming anyone. She does claim to have a dislike for people who break the rules, but she never goes to the extent of killing anyone. She would want them to be punished, but not in such a way that these people wouldn’t see the light of day the next morning.With brand new information about the new person who had taken the illegal U-turn, the police headed out to hunt the next victim. As the police inform the next victim about remaining safe and sound for the night, in a matter of minutes, the same man dies by throwing himself off the balcony, or at least it looks as if the man killed himself. The police are at a dead end with no evidence in hand.

There is a police officer in this team named Indarjeet Singh Dhillon who barfs at the sight of blood even though he has spent crucial years of his life in forensics. The man is supposed to be Mr. Know-it-all, and he is the one who lets his teammates know that this might be the work of some paranormal entity. But he is also the person who knows all about police work because he has been in the force for a while. He is the go-to man whenever any inquiry work must be done. With the investigating team reaching a dead end in this matter, Radhika tries to stop the men who are about to take a U-turn on that bridge. They do not fall for her pleas, and in a fit, Radhika also takes a U-turn just to experiment with what would happen to her. Radhika volunteered to understand who would confront her and in what form. This is the risk she is ready to take because she has no other option.

The boys who were caught taking the U-turn were put behind bars to keep them safe from any untoward incidents. But things go awry when the boys are killed in the lockup rather brutally. The police are in shock to see what exactly is following these people and what is leading them to kill themselves in such a way. At Radhika’s home, she is haunted by her deceased brother. This is the trauma that she lives with. She and her brother were in a car accident years ago, and she was the one who survived while her brother, unfortunately, passed away. She never got over this tragedy and has been guilty of not being the one who drove the car. Radhika is either hallucinating or is confronted by her brother Raghav’s ghost, which lets her know that it was never her fault and that she should get over the guilt that is slowly killing her. Radhika wonders if the people who committed suicide were followed by a ghost, just like she was confronted by Raghav, that could potentially push them to commit suicide. But Raghav was only here to free her from the guilt. Radhika was quick to understand that no ghost or paranormal activity was surrounding the victim; it was just a serial killer who played with the victim’s mind and pushed them to commit suicide.

But again, the police and Radhika come to a dead end on who might be the serial killer after all. There was no evidence found on them during the post-mortem as well, which makes it difficult for the investigating team to find a concrete lead that would indicate their involvement with the serial killer. Radhika and Arjun change track and start investigating the people who died in the accident; maybe from there, they could find someone who might be killing these people who are taking the illegal U-turn. One accident that was not reported in any newspaper, as per Radhika, is that of Sunita Singh. Her very young daughter died in that accident, too, of which there was no report. Radhika and Arjun are adamant about getting the lead, and somehow they are sure Sunita Singh’s information might take them somewhere. They want to know why Sunita Singh’s death was not covered and why there is no record of it in the police stations as well. There is something there that is making them pursue it. The car that she was driving belonged to someone else, but the car owner offered to look for the papers that could prove who she was and give them her address. This lead will lead them to a breakthrough.As the investigation is on, Arjun concludes that someone other than Radhika knew of the address, namely the RTO officer named Harry. They could get more information from him, which makes sense. As Arjun is headed toward Radhika’s home, he meets with an accident. Radhika, at the same time, gets the car papers, in which it is mentioned that Sunita Singh’s husband is the officer from the investigation team, Indarjeet Singh Dhillon. As both conclude the man has something to do with the killings, he kidnaps Radhika. He lets her know that the moment she mentions the possibility of doing a visceral report on the dead bodies, it would probably help the police get more information about what the victims consumed. Dhillon was quick to conclude that Radhika was getting closer to finding out that he was the serial killer. Sunita Singh was his wife, who died in the accident along with their child. Being a policeman, he did not find any help to solve this case as soon as possible and find the culprit. That is why he took it upon himself to kill those people who always took the illegal U-turn. Dhillon managed to get hold of the addresses of the victims from Harry, the RTO officer and Indrajeet’s brother. He killed those people because he felt it was the right way to handle a person who did not value other people’s lives over taking a U-turn to save some time. He wanted them to suffer the same fate as his wife and daughter. He used a fear drug, aka Blue Daisy, on them, which pushed them to face their fears and threats, and that led to them killing themselves. The man used this drug on every person he knew who was taking a U-turn and managed to get rid of people who were breaking the rules and endangering other lives as well.With the same fear drug, he plans to kill Radhika, but she manages to escape and runs off to the roof of the building, where she is held hostage. She lets him know that he could have helped her or the police solve this matter the legal way instead of going all vigilante. No one deserves to die, and people taking the illegal U-turn should not be executed but apprehended. There could have been so many ways to deal with the matter, but killing people is not the solution. Dhillon realizes that if she survives, it would be the end of him, and he starts hallucinating his wife and daughter. With the urge to join them on the other side , he falls off the building, killing himself. Dhillon knew his arrest would be humiliating. He figured killing himself would be a better option. With Dhillon not alive, Arjun and Radhika’s search for the serial killer is now over. They have nothing more to do but be shocked that someone among them was carrying out the crime. It is disappointing for them not to get Dhillon alive with the serial killer out of the way. Radhika is going back to finishing her story and probably letting the citizens know their actions could have serious repercussions. The last scene of “U-Turn” has Radhika calling the colleague, and he happens to be the man who moves the stones on the road to go back at the beginning of the film. His actions led to Dhillon’s wife and child dying in an accident caused by stones on the road. Dhillon could, unfortunately, never trace this case back to Radhika and her colleague.

But when Monty turned 15, something bad happened. Gary came home very drunk and said sorry to Monty's mom, but he accidentally said another woman's name instead of her name. This made Monty's mom really mad, so she yelled at Gary. Gary was so drunk that he hit her and she fell and got hurt really badly. Sadly, Monty's mom didn't make it and passed away. David, who was really angry, pushed Gary away. And when Monty tried to go to his mom, David pushed him away too. David blamed both his dad and Monty for their mom's death.

She is raised by her father, Moropanth and Peshwa Bajirao II in Bithoor. She is a favourite of the Peshwa and he has brought her up with lot of love. One day Dixit Ji of Jhansi spots her facing a ferocious tiger fearlessly. Impressed, he asks Peshwa for her hand in marriage with Maharaja of the Maratha ruled princely state of Jhansi, Gangadhar Rao.

The marriage takes place and as per the tradition the king gives her a new name – ‘Laxmibai’ . All these developments upset Gangadhar's brother Sadashiv Rao. He is friendly with the British and wants to usurp the throne by hook or by crook. Laxmibai, after a few years, gives birth to Damodar and she is unable to contain her happiness. Her joy however is short-lived as Sadashiv surreptitiously poisons Damodar. Gangadhar, at the same time, falls ill too. Knowing that his death is near, he and Laxmibai decide to adopt a son who will rule Jhansi in future. Much to Sadashiv's dismay, his son is not adopted and instead, ‘Anand Rao’ , the son of a courtier, is named the heir. He was renamed as Laxmibai instinctively calls him Damodar Rao. Gangadhar passes away and the British attempt to annexe the throne. However, Laxmibai surprises everyone as she decides to take over the reins. She proclaims herself as the queen of Jhansi and challenges the British openly. When the British force her to vacate the palace, she walks gracefully into the village and is welcomed and greeted by a massive parade of villagers led by Jhalkaribai.

The East India Company requests the British government to appoint Sir Hugh Rose to salvage the situation and remove Laxmibai from the throne permanently. Knowing very well that she will soon be attacked again, Laxmibai begins training her own army and especially women to fight. Laxmibai assembles an army of 20,000 troops and Pathans join her later in 1858. During the siege of Jhansi, Laxmibai valiantly steps into the battlefield to destroy the British cannons strategically placed in front of a temple. The strong fort walls keep Laxmibai and her army steady until Sadashiv Rao divulges secrets about the fort to the British who finally break the siege and manage to storm the keep, resulting in the death of ‘Gaus-Baba’. Jhalkaribai despite discovering that she is pregnant acts as a decoy pretending to be the queen due to her striking resemblance to Laxmibai. She manages distract the British army so that Laxmibai along with Damodar could escape the castle safely. Jhalkaribai sacrifices herself in a major gunpowder explosion killing numerous British officers along with her. Laxmibai escapes to Kalpi to reunite with Tatya Tope and other allies. She captures the princely state of Gwalior and motivates the troops to participate in the war. With a heavy heart, Laxmibai leaves Damodar and leads an attack on the British. Laxmibai bravely sets out to attack the huge British army but then faces a certain defeat. Laxmibai gets shot by one of the British soldiers, while taking her last breath she looks at Hugh Rose and immolates herself in a fire to avoid being captured and humiliated by the British. After Laxmibai's death, Jhansi is surrendered to the British Government in 1860 on behalf of Damodar Rao. Damodar Rao although survived, but lived a life suffering from prolonged illness and dire poverty, dying at the age of 58 in 1903.

8908002,Luka Chuppi,Comedy Romance time live married couple relationships marriage family times campaign wedding admit star,Comedy Romance Pretending cohabitate families married order small-town couple lands endless awkward situations hide truth orthodox,"Vishnu Trivedi, a failing politician in the small town of Mathura, campaigns to ban live-in relationships, seeing them as a disgrace to the Indian conservative culture. At the same time, his party begins to lead an all-out campaign against film star Nazeem Khan, who is allegedly in a live-in relationship with his girlfriend, exactly the cause behind his grudge against live-in relationships.

Vishnu's daughter Rashmi takes up an internship at a local news channel, and starts working with the channel's star reporter Vinod ""Guddu"" Shukla and his best friend, cameraman Abbas Sheikh. Guddu and Rashmi fall in love and Guddu proposes to her. Not ready for marriage, she suggests a live-in relationship, but he, being more traditional and somewhat scared of Vishnu, disagrees. As a compromise, Abbas suggests trying a live-in relationship during their 20-day business trip to Gwalior. The couple agree.

They rent an apartment in a conservative area by pretending to be a married couple. Eventually, they get closer and have sex several times. Their nosy neighbor, Mrs. Srivastava, sees them during one such act and becomes suspicious of their marital status. To further complicate problems, they mix-up their answers when asked about their wedding-date. She plans to gather the neighborhood to oust the couple next morning, but Guddu and Rashmi come up with fake photographs and wedding mementos overnight, leaving her plans adrift. At the end of twenty days, he reaffirms his love and she accepts his marriage proposal. Before they can leave Gwalior, Guddu's relative Babulal sees the two together, follows them, sees the wedding pictures, and assumes that they eloped.

The next morning, Babulal brings Guddu's entire family to their house and they chastise him for eloping. Guddu and Rashmi, realising that the family would willingly accept a marriage but not a cohabitation, do not admit the truth. All of them go back to Mathura to meet Rashmi's family and tell them about it. Vishnu, however, is happy to hear that his daughter decided to get married instead of cohabiting. He even details the deadly consequences, should they have cohabited instead. Scared, the couple fails to admit the truth.

Although they begin living like a married couple, they resent the fact that they are not legally married. They make multiple attempts to get married in secret, but are intruded every time; in a last-ditch attempt, they try to get married in a mass marriage event. Vishnu, however, being the chief guest, catches them red-handed. Exasperated, they admit that they had been cohabiting.

Once his family, too, catches up, Guddu reveals to Vishnu that the main reason for his loss in elections is his reluctance to change; since the majority of the voting group is the young generation, which believes in modernity, opposing the youth's methods would equal lack of support from them. He successfully convinces Vishnu to stop opposing live-in relationships and finally marries Rashmi with his blessings.

The story ends with Guddu and Rashmi covering a rally led by Vishnu, who is shown to have joined hands with Nazeem for his election campaign.","['Comedy', 'Romance']","Pretending to be married in order to cohabitate, a small-town couple lands in endless awkward situations to hide the truth from their orthodox families.","14 Phere,Welcome Back,Jayeshbhai Jordaar,Doordarshan,Hum Do Hamare Do,Jug Jugg Jeeyo"

As a result of this, the boy became a dangerous and vengeful individual. The next sequence shows the girls going missing on their birthdays, followed by Megha Sharma, the investigating officer, searching for the victim. When they discovered that these innocent girls were being murdered, they enlisted the help of forensic expert Johnny Khanna to find the perpetrator.Right from the beginning, the intense atmosphere and dark tone sets up the mood of the film. The dramatic twists and turns of the story, which are required for these genres, as well as the fact that it is unpredictable from the beginning, make it the most intriguing aspect. Many crime thrillers in Hindi cinema, such as Drishyam and others, have shown cops failing to find the culprit; however, this film demonstrates the prowess of police and other departments in attempting to solve crimes. The film depicts in great detail how forensic investigators examine crime scenes for evidence, such as blood, fluid, fingerprints, or residue, in order to determine how a crime occurred.Forensic features Radhika and Vikrant in prominent roles. Vikrant Massey plays a convincing forensic expert who is meticulous in gathering crime-related evidence and making it appear authentic to viewers.

18923048,Operation Romeo,Drama Mystery Oper Romeo cops king n’t sks finds ble bout home house find birth rents,Drama Mystery policing film features fears stresses youthful couples nation experience danger presented moral,"“Operation Romeo” begins with Aditya wishing Neha a happy birthday and both of them planning a date. It is shown that Neha comes from a very conservative family and is extremely wary of keeping the details of her college life hidden from her parents—something most Asian women are familiar with. The next day, both of them set out on their date and have a good time. Adi is shown to be a somewhat possessive person. For example, his face turns sour when Neha jokes with him that a male classmate of hers gave her some flowers for her birthday. Or when another guy is checking out Neha at a café, Adi very aggressively tells him not to. Another subtle instance of this is seen when some of the boys in his building are preparing to get into a fight with someone, and Adi tells them to land a few punches on his behalf as well. In a way, it can be understood that he is a typical Indian guy—with set ideas about what it means to be a man and a so-called “protector.”


On the date, as both Adi and Neha get comfortable with each other, Adi asks Neha for a kiss. But their moment is interrupted by a man banging on their car door. He says that he is Mangesh Yadav, the sub-inspector of the area, and that Adi and Neha are in trouble for public indecency. Both of them are scared, especially Neha. She can’t afford this news to reach her house, as that would get her in a lot of trouble with her parents. Adi requests the cops to let them go, but they refuse to relent. After requesting a lot, Mangesh agrees to let them off if they pay him a certain amount of money. Aditya agrees and drives to an ATM. But there is another problem at hand, as he seems quite smitten by Neha and keeps making inappropriate comments towards her. Adi tries his best to protect her, but there is only so much he can do.

At the ATM, he finds that the machine is out of service. He rushes back to the car, and the cops decide to drive till they find another ATM. But Mangesh keeps staring at Neha, making the couple extremely uncomfortable. There is an atmosphere of fear that the cops are taking advantage of. At one point, Adi agrees to go to the cops instead of continuing with the cat and mouse game. But it doesn’t work out as Neha is scared of her parents finding out. The three of them finally find an ATM, and as Adi rushes to withdraw the money, he finds that Mangesh has locked the car with himself and Neha in it. He runs back, only to find her in tears. It is unclear what has happened, but it is obvious that Mangesh has behaved inappropriately with her.


Either way, he takes the money from Adi and tells them to leave. The couple, free of the cops, go back home. Once they arrived, Adi asked Neha what had happened in the car. He tells her that he needs to know as a man. Neha, in reply, says “man,” and the question mark is clear in her sentence. It could mean that she feels that Adi failed to protect her as a “woman,” or it could also be a reference to the ridiculousness of the question, as she is the victim in this case. But Adi has interpreted it as her questioning his masculinity, and he is unable to come to terms with that. This brings us to the next part of the film.

Aditya keeps thinking about the events of that night, especially since he feels that his masculinity has been questioned. And that sets him on a path of revenge. He tracks down Mangesh and finds that he wasn’t even a cop, to begin with. He was an ambulance driver, and he had just taken advantage of the situation. He finds out his address and goes to his house at a time when Mangesh isn’t home. His wife, Chhaya, is at home with their daughter. Adi pretends to have come there to discuss a contract with Mangesh, and Chhaya allows him to wait in the house till he arrives. But once inside, he makes it a point to make Chhaya as uncomfortable as possible. Be it him making a drawing of Mangesh as a dog, or him entering their kitchen to taste the food without Chhaya’s permission, or just hiding her phone. Chhaya, knowing something is wrong, asks him to leave. But luckily, that is when Mangesh arrives. That’s when Adi turns the tables. He gives him a taste of his own medicine by repeating some of the inappropriate lines Mangesh had said to Neha. Chhaya starts suspecting that there was some history between the men.

In the scuffle that follows, Adi injures Mangesh. When a few of his friends call out for him outside his house, Adi holds a broken shard of glass to his daughter’s neck, signaling him to keep quiet. The friends, thinking Mangesh isn’t home, talk about how he is an absolute womanizer and how he took advantage of a couple just the past week. All of it is overheard by Chhaya. Now she asks Mangesh what he has done to Neha. Having no other choice, he admits that, upon finding himself alone with her, he had asked her for a kiss. But she had refused, and when he had insisted, she slapped him. That’s when Adi returned to the car. These were the exact events of that night. Finally, knowing the truth, Adi apologizes to Chhaya and warns Mangesh to never repeat such things, because there is someone out there who is more man than him.

The next day, he meets Neha. She asks him why he has been ignoring her calls all week. He tells her what he did, and Neha asks him if it would have mattered if something had actually happened to her that night. Adi goes silent for a minute, but then he changes the topic by taking out a ring. He tells Neha that he has been carrying this with him since her birthday. As he is about to put it on her finger, she gives him the middle finger. To quote one of our favorite dialogues from another favorite series, “All it took was one gesture of courage to shatter centuries of patriarchy.” And that was the most beautiful ending that had us applauding Neha and the storyline. It was a gesture that literally changed our idea of who the real hero was in a matter of a second.

12887178,14 Phere,Comedy Romance wedding family fake marriage couple parents weddings plan situation real theatre decide families Jat,Comedy Romance Jaipur Sanjay Rajput Jat love married families parents hurt succeed plan arranging fake set,"College sweethearts Aditi Karwasra  and Sanjay Lal Singh  find themselves in a complicated love mix when their orthodox families decide to meddle in who they should get married to.

Belonging from different castes — Sanjay, a Rajput from Bihar and Aditi, a Jat from Rajasthan — getting their happily ever after appears to be a long-distant dream.

However, in a heated situation, Sanjay lies about Aditi’s caste to his family, complicating the situation even further.Therein begins the elaborate plan for two ‘real’ weddings, amateur theatre actors as parents, fake ‘baraatis’, and dramatic marriage sequences.

Following a slip-of-tongue blunder, the duo stumble upon a complicated plan of arranging fake parents to meet up with the real ones to fix their weddings.

They manage to acquire two theatre actors for the job — Amay  as the self-retired actor turned fake father, and Zubina , Delhi’s Meryl Streep turned fake mother.

Their first target is Aditi’s love-marriage opposed family. They set the plan in motion by planting the phoney parents in the same train compartment as Aditi’s maternal uncle, who is going to Jaipur.

Through clever manoeuvring, they create a situation where Aditi’s uncle proposes her marriage to Sanjay. They have a marriage meeting where Sanjay’s fake families meet with Aditi’s real one, and the well-designed horoscope is given the green signal.

The second target, of course, turns out to be Sanjay’s Rajput family. Herein, Aditi’s fake family pretends to be Rajput and helps settle the marriage decision in the couple’s favour.

Two Weddings
The plotline soon draws to the highlight of the movie that are the two weddings, both real in their approach.

The first is the Rajputi wedding that takes place in Delhi. Sanjay, along with his family, reaches the wedding venue. Along with the theatre actors-turned-parents, Sanjay and Aditi’s office mates join the act as the bride’s side of the family.

The wedding, however, commences without any hassle. Aditi reaches Sanjay’s family home in Bihar, where she is welcomed with all pomp and show.

The day soon comes when the couple has to get to Delhi to prepare for wedding number 2. At that moment, Sanjay’s cousin Chotu , comes to know of the story both have created, and the couple has to escape without a word.

After reaching Delhi, they find Sanjay’s parents already at their place while Chotu clears the air by confirming that he is not opposed to their marriage. But the duo has to go to Aditi’s place for the second wedding and make an excuse about attending a friend’s wedding.

Sanjay’s father is already suspicious about him going to his elder sister’s secret wedding, who had run out with the guy she loved. He decides to trail them and catch them red-handed.

Meanwhile, the couple and the fake baraatis reach Rajasthan for their second wedding. However, hell soon breaks loose when a travel agent/ family friend recognises Sanjay and acquires the wedding photographs from their first marriage.

After Aditi’s family comes to know of their betrayal, they decide to punish the couple for hurting the “honour” of the family.

While Aditi’s brother goes to get the gun, the couple makes a run for their lives.

However, right outside the wedding venue, they are encountered with Sanjay’s real family, who arrived with a different narrative in their minds.

Both families are enraged at the wedding plan they have weaved and threaten each other with their lives. The fake parents also arrive on the scene. Aditi’s brother is adamant about setting the fake father on fire and pours petrol on him.

Just at that moment, elders from Aditi’s side of the family come to enquire about the situation. The duo tries to reason with their fathers that no one knows about the inter-caste wedding, and they can get away with it and save their honour at the same time.

After a moment’s speculation, they decide that it’s a much better approach than bloodshed and agree to the marriage. The film culminates with a happy ending.

He is very stereotypical towards Muslims. He starts his days with the old songs of a Punjabi Sikh pop singer Manjeet Manchala , who has now stopped producing albums and disappeared mysteriously. As well as this, he has regular arguments with a Muslim man named Nawab Mehmood Nazim Ali Shah Khan Bahadur  who happens to live in the same area as him. Dharampal later visits his late mother's bank vault to collect her belongings. He then finds adoption papers certifying he was adopted in 1960 and that his biological parents were Muslims.This shocks him, considering how much he dislikes Muslims, and he decides to keep this a secret. Eventually, he admits to Nawab that he is also a Muslim, and that he must find his real father in order to speak to him. They discover that his father is in critical condition due to old age, living in an senior home. The Imaam taking care of his father tells Dharampal that if his father saw that his only son has been brought up as a non-Muslim, it could cause severe damage to his health. Therefore, he tells Dharampal to learn how to become a true Muslim and come back to meet his father once he is ready.With the help of Shah, he begins to learn the ways of Muslim people. However, the Imaam declines Dharampal's request to meet his father once again, claiming he is still not coming across as a true Muslim.

However, before they arrive at the senior home, his father has already died. Furious over the whole situation, Dharampal tries to bring down Neelanand, the main cause of most of his troubles. He then accidentally discovers that Neelanand Baba's eye twitches due to Blepharospasm, a very rare abnormality causing contraction of the eyelid, which the Punjabi pop singer Manjeet Manchala also suffered from.This reminds Dharampal that Manchala had disappeared years ago, and then matches the voices of Manchala and Neelanand, confirming they are the same person. He then crashes an event of Neelanand and reveals to a large audience how Neelanand Baba is actually a born Sikh and has been a fraud and characterless pop-singer with various cases lodged against him for adulterous relationships with many women.

8983180,Made in China,Comedy Drama product business successful sexual General entrepreneur proposes rejects sex death partnership family commission meet,Comedy Drama Businessman Failed Gujarati Story idea life jumps unknown world time business change,"During a cultural event in Gujarat, a Chinese delegate, General Zeng, consumes a product called Tiger Soup and dies. The investigation into his death points towards the Tiger Soup, which he consumed just moments before passing out and away, as a possible cause of death, and CBI officers Sharma and Gupta look for Raghuvir ""Raghu"" Mehta, the product's original manufacturer, who eventually surrenders himself to the authorities upon severe interrogation.

Over a flashback, it is shown that Raghu has been a failed Gujarati entrepreneur who lives with his wife Rukmini and his son Chintu. Despite being in charge of his late father's mattress business, which everybody including him now feels has been sustaining losses for too long, he struggles to come up with a profitable business idea and has cycled through several products which have failed to take off. His uncle forces him to go on a trip to China with his cousin Devraj where he is to meet investors about a sports drink business. While in China, Devraj presents his product to Tanmay, a successful Gujarati entrepreneur, who rejects it. Despondent over the rejection, as Devraj abandons him to his own devices, Raghu strikes up a bond with Tanmay who explains the philosophy behind entrepreneurship to him. Raghu goes on a drunken binge with Devraj's contact Xui Lee, and in a stupor, commits to meet her boss Hao Li while posing as Devraj.

During the meeting, Hao introduces Raghu to Tiger Penis Soup which is the Chinese equivalent of Viagra. Hao proposes that Raghu shall sell this product in India and suggests that it will be successful over there because Chinese and Indians are constantly thinking about sex. While researching the market in India, Raghu realizes that there is no genuine solution available for sexual problems faced by men. Raghu proposes a business partnership to Dr. Tribhuvan Vardhi, a sexologist whose books have impressed Raghu, but Vardhi initially rejects the offer. Meanwhile, Raghu's inability to provide a steady income for his family creates tension between him and Rukmini. Raghu proceeds to recruit Vardhi with the promise of spreading sex awareness to the public and eventually Vardhi agrees. Back in the present, General Zeng's autopsy is held up in diplomatic red tape, forcing Sharma and Gupta into trying to get to the truth through Raghu, who remains adamant about nothing being faulty with his product.

Rewinding to the past, Raghu puts together a team of talented young professionals to handle manufacturing and distribution of the product. After some initial struggles, Raghu meets Tanmay who suggests Vardhi as the face of their product. The team arranges a seminar but Vardhi accidentally walks into a parent-teacher conference; his impassioned plea to make sexual discourse normal in society goes viral. As a result, the Tiger Soup business is wildly successful. However, Raghu hides the product from Rukmini and his extended family who think that he is running a business related to Chinese fans. Devraj soon finds out that the Tiger Soup is behind Raghu's success. Raghu meets his idol Abhay Chopra, a successful investor and motivational speaker, who is in league with Devraj. Chopra proposes a business partnership but Raghu rejects the proposal; in retaliation, Devraj reveals to the family that Raghu is running the ostensibly disreputable Tiger Soup business.

Chintu is expelled from his school when a bottle of Tiger Soup is found in his bag. Once a livid Rukmini finds out that Raghu lied about his business, she confronts him about it. A distressed Raghu goes to Vardhi to end their partnership but a timely call from Tanmay causes him to reconsider. Back to the present, Raghu and Vardhi appear before a preliminary commission consisting of several government agencies to explain their role in Zeng's death. Raghu reveals that there is no secret ingredient in the soup; it is just Rabdi, an Indian dessert, and implies that most sexual issues are more psychological than biological. Vardhi appeals to the commission not to consider sex as a taboo topic and encourages them to let the product continue instead of banning it. However, while bureaucratic pressures from the Chinese delegation force the commission to ban the Tiger Soup for some time, Raghu and Vardhi are acquitted and convey to the media that they are happy the product was not banned completely.

At the end, Raghu is shown as a successful owner of a chain of sexual health-related clinics with Vardhi as the face of the business and he is invited to a premier business school to give a lecture on being an entrepreneur. Rukmini is overwhelmed at the success of her husband and the achievements he has made. Raghu ends the story with the same catchphrase that Tanmay had previously taught him.","['Comedy', 'Drama']","Story of Failed Gujarati Businessman, who jumps into unknown world of China to get once in a life time business idea, which will change his life.","Marjaavaan,Raja Natwarlal,Baazaar,Pagalpanti,Drishyam 2,Why Cheat India"
10333912,Gulabo Sitabo,Comedy Drama mansion tenants money pay plans site heritage alternative housing claims antique rent makes property,Comedy Drama upmanship scheming attracting men caught game members clan agenda,"Chunnan 'Mirza' Nawab  is a stingy old ghar jamai who is regarded by most people he knows as a greedy miser. His wife, Fatima Begum , who is 17 years older than him, is the owner of Fatima Mahal, a run-down mansion in Lucknow whose rooms are being leased out to various tenants, many of whom are not paying appropriate rent. Begum leaves Mirza with the responsibility of tending to the property, but Mirza cannot wait for Begum's death, so the mansion can be passed down to him. Baankey Rastogi  is a poor tenant of the mansion who lives with his mother and three sisters. He owns a wheat mill shop, and consistently makes and claims for why he can't pay his long-overdue rent despite being charged even less than all the other tenants, much to Mirza's chagrin.

As a result, Mirza nags him to pay his dues whenever they cross paths. This leads to Baankey getting frequently irritated, and in an outburst of anger, he starts a chaos by kicking the wall of a toilet block which collapses, thus angering Mirza, who demands Baankey pay the full cost of repair. Baankey, however, does not pay up, so Mirza attempts to make the lives of him and his family miserable, in every way possible. This is the last straw for Baankey, who vows to exact revenge on Mirza.

Baankey gets his opportunity when Gyanesh Shukla , an archaeologist working for the government, realizes the historic value of the property. He quickly makes plans to seize it, evict everyone living in it, and declare it a government-owned heritage site. Gyanesh explains his plans to Baankey, claiming that alternative accommodation will be provided for those evicted. Baankey realizes that Mirza will end up losing his grip on the mansion, so supports Gyanesh with his motives.

Mirza soon finds out about the situation and hires a local lawyer, Christopher Clarke . Mirza plans to get the ownership of the mansion transferred to himself once Begum dies, so he can evict his tenants and keep the mansion for himself. After a lengthy attempt to track down anyone in Begum's family who could inherit the mansion instead of him, the last step is to get a copy of Begum's left-hand fingerprints. However, Mirza successfully acquires fingerprints from a sleeping Begum, but they are from the wrong hand, which angers Christopher. He resorts to forging the prints instead. Having noticed the mansion's state of disrepair, Christopher introduces Mirza to Munmun Singh, a wealthy builder-developer, who is willing to buy the mansion, demolish it, and build a modern housing complex on the land. Christopher claims that Mirza will get a lump sum of money for this and to the tenants, so the latter very hastily agrees.

Unfortunately, Gyanesh's offer of alternative housing for Baankey and the other tenants are false claims, and Gyanesh brings a couple of men to declare the mansion as a heritage site, and also says that all the tenants will have to vacate the house. Arguments and fights begin as Baankey and the tenants are furious that they won't get alternative housing, as promised to them. Suddenly then Christopher arrives with Munmun and the developers, and a suitcase full of money for Mirza and the tenants. Mirza sees the tenants taking some of the money, and sits on the suitcase, proclaiming all the money is his, leading to further furious arguments and fights.

However, they are suddenly interrupted when Begum's maid announces that Begum has gone. Everyone falls in chaos and confusion, including Baankey, who goes up to her room to see her, while Mirza secretly feels happy at first, thinking Begum has died and the mansion is now his. However, Baankey finds nothing but a letter written by Begum to Mirza, in which it is revealed that Begum is still alive, having eloped with her old lover Abdul Rehman and selling the mansion to him for a rupee to preserve it, thus foiling Mirza's plans.

Now, everyone moves out, including Baankey and Mirza, depressed at having to leave the old mansion, which now became an archaeological heritage site. This is worsened by them, Mirza and Baankey being shut out when Begum returns to the mansion to celebrate her 95th birthday with her lover. Begum left behind an antique chair for Mirza, and he remarks to Baankey that he sold it locally for ₹250, which surprises Baankey. The film then closes showing Begum's antique chair in an antique shop in Mumbai, priced at ₹1,35,000.","['Comedy', 'Drama']","Two scheming men get caught up in a game of one upmanship, each one attracting other members to their clan and each one with an agenda of his own.","Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai,Begum Jaan,Roohi,Pagalpanti,Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster,Bajirao Mastani"

They are both accepted in the same college in Delhi, and after a series of adventures, they soon become friends, forming part of a group of four. Akaash and Vani eventually fall in love and embark on a four-year relationship, which is kept secret from Vani's traditional parents.

As their final year ends, Akaash decides to go to the UK for his further studies. Vani returns to her hometown Dehradun to attend her sister's wedding, after which she plans to study for an M.B.A. She tells her sister about her relationship with Akaash, but her sister reacts negatively, saying their parents would disapprove. The next day, amidst the wedding preparation, Vani finds out that her sister has eloped with another man, who she was in love with but was not accepted by her parents. Vani's parents are heartbroken and have to endure the shame of their neighbors and community. In fear of society's response, they decide to marry Vani to a son of an acquaintance. Pressured by her parents and feeling guilt over her sister's actions, Vani reluctantly agrees. She emotionally ends things with Akaash via a phone call and requests him not to try and meet her. Akaash is devastated but slowly becomes bitter and detached with time.

Vani's husband, Ravi Sinha , is a charming but controlling man who pressures Vani to have sex, despite her reluctance. Ravi is emotionally abusive and expects Vani to cater to his every need, but pretends to be a perfect husband in front of friends and family. He prevents her from going out, working, or furthering her studies and expects her to be a full-time housewife. After an argument, Vani returns home and reveals her unhappiness to her parents. However, they send her back to Ravi after he charms them and ask him to consider starting a family to occupy Vani's time. Time goes by and Vani slowly begins losing self-confidence and becomes resigned to her fate. One day, Vani's aunt and uncle unexpectedly come to visit her and suggest she go back with them for several days to Delhi to attend her college reunion.

Vani tells Akaash the truth about her marriage but says she cannot divorce Ravi because her parents won't handle it, especially after her sister eloped. Akaash tells his friend that he hopes to reunite with Vani and plans to fill her days with adventures and happiness. He hopes this will raise her spirits and give her the courage to leave Ravi. The group travel to Chandigarh where Akaash and Vani spend time alone together and rekindle their romance. The trip is cut short by a phone call from Vani's parents, requesting she visits them. Conflicted, Vani chooses to return home and emotionally leaves Shekhar, Sumbul, and Akaash behind.

Akaash decides he can't lose Vani again, and the group follows Vani to her home. They stay happily with Vani's parents until Ravi arrives there, too. Akaash observes how Vani assumes the role of a subservient wife and how her husband ill-treats her. That night, Vani finally realizes that she can no longer live with a man who cannot respect her. Right away, in front of her friends and Ravi, she reveals the truth to her parents about the rape and emotional abuse Ravi has inflicted on her and demands a divorce. They are stunned and try to reason with her, but she stands her ground. An argument breaks out, and she slaps Ravi, after which he moves to hit her, only to be stopped by Akaash. Ravi realizes that the two are in love and insults Vani's parents. Vani's parents are embarrassed, but she defiantly tells them that her happiness is more important than their shame and leaves the house.

Vani returns to Delhi with her friends, where she finally furthers her studies and gets her M.B.A. degree. She happily divorces Ravi and later marries Akaash.","['Drama', 'Romance']",Follows the love story of a boy and a girl.,"Hungama 2,Atrangi Re,Sadak 2,Always Kabhi Kabhi,Veere Di Wedding,Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan"
1887763,Haunted - 3D,Action Fantasy Horror spirit ying nsion letter kes finds inside serv door bout driver repe,Action Fantasy Horror ghostly mansion realtor finds accompanied entities inside place happening learns violent event back time prevent,"Rehan travels to Koti, Shimla, to prepare a mansion Glen Manor for sale for his father's real estate company. He learns that the mansion's caretaker died two days ago from a heart attack due to the house being haunted. Although he refuses to believe this at first, he meets a rag picker telling him that only he will be able to stop the haunting.

Mysterious things happen over the next few nights, exactly at 3:00 am. Rehan saves himself from a few fatal attacks, hears repeated screams of a woman, sees a girl singing and playing the piano who vanishes when he opens the door; a book drops from a bookshelf on its own and Rehan finds a letter inside. The suicide letter, written by Meera Sabharwal to her parents, tells her story from 1936 when they left for Delhi to attend her brother's wedding and left her behind with her nanny Margaret, a servant and a driver, so that she could prepare for her upcoming exams. In their absence, her piano teacher Iyer tried to rape her during her lessons. However, she saved herself by hitting him hard with a candle stand on his head, which resulted in his death. Soon, the police corroborated Meera's story, as they found a few personal items and explicit sketches of hers drawn by Iyer in his house. However, Iyer, obsessed with Meera, returned in the form of an evil spirit, killing her servant first, then her driver and last of all, Margaret, leaving her all alone in the mansion. He raped Meera repeatedly for the next six days, who ended up committing suicide in despair. Rehan soon realizes that even after her death, her spirit is trapped and tortured inside the mansion by Iyer's spirit to this day.

After reading the letter, he feels sympathetic and brings a psychic, Mrs. Stevens to help, but the woman leaves after realising how much evil and obsessive Iyer's spirit is and asks Rehan to do the same, but he ignores her warning and stays there, challenging Iyer by repeating his name . However, Iyer's spirit appears before him, warning him to get out of the mansion and violently throws him out. Rehan tries to get in again, hearing the screams, but Meera's spirit appears before him too, saying that Iyer will never let him free her from his captivity. A tearful Rehan steps back and kneels down in despair before the thundering mansion, echoing with Meera's screams.

The next morning when he wakes up, he finds the rag-picker in front of him, casting a spell. The spell sends him back 75 years to 17 August 1936, the day when Meera's parents leave for Delhi. Rehan befriends Meera by being shown the way to the city by her, calling himself to be a lost newcomer to the town. The next day, in order to prevent Iyer's death, Rehan arrives at Glen Manor with a basket full of chocolates for Meera as a gift for showing him the way to the city, seconds before Iyer could carry out his intention. Rehan says that he would like to listen to Meera's performance as he is also interested in music, but Iyer asks him to leave. Rehan insists on staying outside the door so he will not interfere in their class and can still listen to her music . As Rehan waits outside the room, Iyer unexpectedly hits him with a stick on the head, throwing him out on the lawn. He bolts the door from inside and tries to assault a horrified Meera. Injured and bleeding, Rehan staggers his way to the door. But, as written in fate, before he could do anything, Meera kills Iyer. A distraught Rehan is admitted to the hospital by Margaret and Meera, where he dreams about Iyer's spirit, saying that he knows he is from the future, his real motive for being there, and says that he will not let him succeed.

Rehan wakes up from the dream the next morning and rushes out of the hospital to save Meera's servant, who, according to her letter, was going to get killed. He is horrified along with Meera, Margaret and the driver when he finds the servant to be dead already. Desperate for her cooperation to help her out, he explains everything to Meera and Margaret and asks them to meet him the next day at noon. The next day, the three of them visit a priest, who tells them that far from the town is a Dargah, a mosque where there is a Sufi Baba who could help them. He tells them to start the journey at 3:00 pm because spirits are weakest at this point of time and they would be safe from Iyer but warns them about the time of 3:00 am, because at this time, all spirits are at their strongest. As it gets dark, the three decide to stay in a hotel. At night, Iyer's spirit possesses Margaret's body through a telephone call and tries to rape Meera again. Rehan fights it and takes Meera straight to the Dargah.

Meera, concerned about Rehan's safety, tries to leave him without caring for herself and calling herself the cause of the whole problem, but Rehan convinces her to let him help by professing his love for her. Both of them share a kiss. Meanwhile, the priest, who was praying for Meera is killed by a snake, who was probably Iyer's spirit. Margaret, still possessed, is present in the forest through which Rehan and Meera are going to the Dargah. She follows and attacks them, but Rehan stabs her in the abdomen with a sharp wood log. Assuming her to be dead, they both bury Margaret's body under some heavy logs. However, she rises from beneath the logs and chases both of them by flying in the air. Margaret kicks Rehan in the head and takes Meera with her in the air , but Rehan realises that in the process of escaping, they have reached the Dargah.

Rehan grabs Margaret's foot just as she was about to fly off with Meera, and manages to put it at the doorstep of the Dargah, thereby forcing Iyer's spirit to leave through the hole in Margaret's abdomen and throwing off her dead body. Inside they find the same rag-picker who sent Rehan into the past, revealing himself to be the Sufi baba.

He tells them that a mile away is a town that was blessed by Khwaja, where there is a well which makes anything reach its place where it belongs to, and in which Meera has to show the way to the spirit, which is connected to her through his blood stained on her pendant when she killed him. As they reach the town, they have to drop the fire, soil, and the pendant . As Meera is performing the act with Rehan by her side, both are interrupted by Iyer's spirit, but Rehan manages to throw the pendant into the well at the last moment, and the spirit is dragged into it. Thus, saving Meera, Rehan accidentally falls into the well too, as was in store for him, and reaches back to the year 2011. He finds another letter written by Meera to him in the same place, thanking him for gifting her a new life and saying that she was distraught at first for losing him forever, but then decided to live a happy life, in order to give importance to the invaluable gift bestowed upon her. A teary-eyed and happy Rehan looks at a smiling Meera in the photo frames on the wall with her family, husband and her child  and sits on the bed with her letter in hand, realising that Glen Manor is no longer haunted.","['Action', 'Fantasy', 'Horror']",A realtor finds himself accompanied by two ghostly entities inside a mansion.

2321163,ABCD (Any Body Can Dance),Drama Music Prabhu Deva dance dancers crew trust team friend discipline Ganesh Acharya,Drama Music employer naturally mettle capable dancer provoked evil design prove,"After having a bitter disagreement with his friend and manager Jehangir Khan  about the latter's blatant abuse of power and influence to win a dance competition called ""Dance Dil Se"" for his team JDC , the choreographer of the dance company, Vishnu , quits his job. At first he wants to return home to Chennai, but his friend Gopi  asks him to stay in Mumbai with him. Vishnu observes several young men using parkour to evade the police. They turn out to be proteges of Gopi, but despite their obvious raw talent, they lack the discipline required to become serious artists; they demonstrate this disastrously at a local event for a politician, wherein they set the stage on fire. After witnessing the youngsters showing their dancing abilities at Ganpati Chaturthi against their equally talented rival neighborhood, Vishnu decides to start his own dance group with them ultimately preparing them to compete in ""Dance Dil Se"". However, the lack of discipline among the dancers and rivalry between the two factions in the group led by D  and Rocky  leads to multiple creative and emotional blocks. Initially, only Rocky and his gang are willing to attend the free classes, but soon D and his friends gravitate towards the studio.They are soon joined by Chandu , a troubled but extraordinarily talented man suffering from a drug addiction, Shaina , a ""bar dancer"", and Rhea , a Westerner who was JDC's star dancer until Jehangir tried to sexually assault her during a ""private instruction"". Rhea immediately becomes the new star of the company. Though the students are initially skeptical of Shaina because of her profession. Chandu demonstrates a great deal of respect for Shaina and defends her in front of the class despite teasing from his peers. The pair quickly fall for one another, leaving quite a few of the boys heartbroken.Despite repeated pleas for peace in the studio, the two main gangs continue to clash, driving Vishnu to his wit's end. However, the students seem to improve and as a reward, he gives them money to buy new speakers, but they nearly lose it all when Rhea takes them to an elite dance club where they challenge the resident champions, a professional dance crew called ""Fictitious Crew"". Vishnu arrives at the last minute and wins back the money, but while his students gain new respect for him he is furious with them. After some hard apologizing, he forgives them and they return to class with greater discipline and drive, only to suddenly be thrown out on the street after D's father calls the cops. During all of this Rocky and Rhea start to fall for each other whilst D burns with jealousy.The community complains that their children should not be mixing in such a way and only through an impromptu dance performance are the youth able to convince their families of the importance of their talent. Only D's conservative and orthodox father refused to accept that his son desires to be a dancer.The crew head to Dance Dil Se and audition, but when Rocky and D fight onstage for Rhea, their chances of appearing on the show in the first place seems bleak. Jehangir, in a bid to humiliate Vishnu publicly, persuades the judges to take the ""Dhongri Dance Revolution"" crew on as a ""comedy act"". Faced with ridicule and the idea that they are a joke and not true dancers, Vishnu asks Rocky and D to do a step that requires a great deal of trust from both, but they cannot muster the trust to manage it. Vishnu has them choose the people they would trust to perform the step with, but then tricks both dancers by blindfolding them and having them attempt it again; this time, they are successful. Vishnu then states that unless the two manage to do the step without blindfolds none of the dancers would be allowed to go home for the night. Several abortive and unsuccessful attempts later D and Rocky take a break and Chandu talks to D and tells him about Bhavana's secret love for D. Bhavana and D get together, D completes the move successfully with Rocky, and the two factions begin to trust each other and work together.Before the semifinals, Chandu prepares to propose to Shaina, but he meets his old drug dealer on the street. Now completely free from the hold of drugs he refuses to fall back into that world, but the dealer, irritated, tosses the ring intended for Shaina at him and it falls into the street. As he retrieves it, Chandu is hit by a truck and killed, leaving the team devastated. Shaina, though barely able to stand from grief, becomes the centerpiece of the team's semifinal routine, in which they express the loss of their friend, bringing audience members to tears.

However, their marriage is on the brink of collapse. Saanchi keeps pressuring Yathaarth to speak with his divorce lawyer, and plans to move to the United Kingdom. One day, Yathaarth sees the news, at work, that Haq Riyaz Gul, a terrorist, has entered his apartment, when Saanchi was alone. Baffled, he rushes to the apartment complex, only to find that the Mumbai Police is already present. ACP Harishchandra Malik tries to negotiate with Gul, but in vain. Meanwhile, the media, who are present outside the apartment complex, receive news about the hostage situation and try to sensationalize it. Yathaarth informs Malik that Saanchi was recently diagnosed with delusional disorder, and that as time goes on, she can become more dangerous than Gul, if she does not take her prescribed pills.Meanwhile, in the apartment, Saanchi calmly tells Gul that Yaatharth is trying to give her the wrong medication, as to make her lose her sanity. She also tells him that once Yaatharth succeeds with his plan, he can keep her wealth, as caretaker, whilst also continue his relationship with her psychiatrist, Vidya, whom she caught multiple times, when they were being sketchy around her. Furious and annoyed about the situation, Gul tells Saanchi to stay silent. When Malik contacts Gul, Yaatharth pleads with Gul, to give Saanchi her medication. Otherwise, she will soon have a relapse. Overhearing the conversation between Yaatharth and Gul, Saanchi asks Gul to not administer it, while flirting with him.After having sex, Gul tells Sanchi that he did not know about the bomb he delivered to the boy's hostel, which eventually killed 13 people. He states that he was betrayed by his uncle, from Kashmir, in delivering the bomb instead of an actual courier. Since all the evidence pointed towards him, he was convicted. Later, Gul threatens Malik, of killing Saanchi, if his demands are not met. When Yaatharth insists on going to his apartment, alone, with Malik and the police, they both get into a heated argument, regarding the next course of action.In the apartment, as Saanchi seduces Gul, they plan to make Saanchi a fake hostage, to escape from the police' clutches. As they act on their plan, Saanchi alerts the police on his gun's magazine being empty, betraying Gul's trust, in front of the police. However, Gul manages to bring Saanchi back to the apartment. Saanchi soon starts behaving differently, asking about Gul's identity and how he managed to get into the apartment. Vexed, Gul ties Saanchi to a chair, in the living room. It is revealed that Gul actually gave Saanchi her pills, through the chai she made earlier.After some time, Saanchi, again, tries to initiate sex with Gul, but he gets second thoughts, while being intimate with her. Saanchi then proceeds to tell Gul that all men are the same: Yaatharth, Gul, and 'him'. Gul has a change of heart again, and disposes of her pills, stating that he plans to run away with her. Meanwhile, Malik and Yaatharth decide on Yaatharth getting the ransom money, of INR 50 lakhs, so that they can arrest Gul and diffuse the situation, quickly. When Yaatharth goes up to his apartment, with the ransom money, multiple shots are heard. Malik and the police rush to the apartment, only to find Saanchi dead, in the arms of Yaatharth, with the shots fired at her. Gul proclaims to the police that Yaatharth shot and killed her, instead of him.At the court, Yaatharth states that once he entered the apartment, Saanchi immediately asked for Yaatharth's help. Gul fired multiple shots at her, killing her, when she betrayed him, again. As per Gul's testimony, when Yaatharth entered the apartment, both Saanchi and him verbally abused each other. Yaatharth then tried to take the gun from Gul, but they both got into a tussle. However, Yaatharth managed to fire multiple shots at Saanchi, even when the gun was in Gul's hands. Malik states to the court that when Gul was in his custody, he came to know that he was actually delusional and hands in the medical and psychological reports, as evidence, proving the same. The court maintains the earlier death sentence of Gul's, with Saanchi being added to his list of victims. However, since he has been diagnosed with a mental illness, the death sentence can only be carried out once he has been cured of it.It is later revealed that Yaatharth did give the wrong medication to Saanchi, with the help of Vidya, with whom he was having an affair. The third person Saanchi referred to Gul, was actually Malik, with whom she was planning to flee, to the United Kingdom, from Yaatharth. But, when Malik insisted on staying in India, as he has a family, Saanchi blackmailed Malik, of falsely raping her. It was Malik who allowed Gul of escaping from his custody, so that he can reach Saanchi and kill her, avoiding a death sentence, as promised by Malik. Gul, having killed nobody, later loses his sanity, and imagines Saanchi, when he is transferred to the mental institution for treatment.","['Crime', 'Drama', 'Thriller']","When a housewife with a personality disorder is taken hostage by a terrorist on the loose and a husband accused of cheating on his wife, have their own versions of reality, how do we know what the truth is?","Aiyaary,No Problem,Thank You,AK vs AK,Modi Ji Ki Beti,Looop Lapeta"
10309902,Chehre,Drama Mystery Thriller RDIN game trial case Dhritiman Rhea Chakraborty play mock charge defence starts wife house real renowned,Drama Mystery Thriller story man wrongs penchant real life games repercussions hearing judgment makes lifetime fact decisions decision,"Sameer Mehra , a business tycoon takes shelter at an old man's home in the mountains amidst a dangerous snow storm. He is introduced to Jagdish Acharya , a retired judge, Paramjeet Singh Bhullar , a renowned defence counsel, Anna Matthews , a house help and one Hariya Jadhav . They are later joined by Lateef Zaidi , a renowned public prosecutor who has a sharp wit and an eye for detail.

Lateef initiates a conversation with Sameer to check if he is the right subject for a practical game they play amongst themselves. Sameer introduces himself as a successful and ambitious executive of an ad agency who achieved everything on his own since he was orphaned from the age of 15. When Sameer takes a break, Lateef remarks to his friends that he is absolutely sure that Sameer is the right subject for their game, and as everyone values his opinion, they agree to this.

Everyone coerces Sameer to play the game, and he agrees. Later, Joe Matthews , an ex-convict accused of murder, joins them. Jagdish tells Sameer that he had pronounced judgement in Joe's case as he was caught killing the person who sexually assaulted his sister, and now that he has served his sentence, they are all on good terms with him.

The game is basically a mock trial wherein they setup a court and argue about some famous cases. Sameer agrees to be their defendant as Anna has not prepared for a famous case Lateef had earlier asked her for. Jagdish tells Sameer his rights and tells him that he can meet his defence counsel, Bhullar, to discuss his case before the court starts. When they both meet in private, Sameer tells Bhullar that he has committed no crime so his case won't stand in court, but Bhullar opposes this, saying that going without any criminal charge in the mock court is dangerous since the prosecutor would then have complete freedom to charge him with anything. Sameer rejects this idea and says that he would go without any charge.

As the court starts, Lateef is able to extract intimate details of Sameer's professional life, to which Sameer naively answers all questions honestly in the beginning, but Lateef is able to correctly point that he had an affair with his boss's wife. On further inquisition, he concludes that Sameer colluded with his boss' wife to kill him and later advance to the position of the CEO. At this point, the mock trial becomes real and the judge notifies that charges are to be framed and the trial started. He then gives time to the defence to prepare for the trial.

During this break, Sameer learns that Hariya is a retired hangman and Joe is, in fact, Anna's brother. Scared, he tries to escape from the house, but Joe prevents that from happening. Sameer now realises he is completely trapped. As the trial starts, Lateef presents a video from Sameer's phone as evidence of his illicit relationship with Natasha , his late boss G.S. Oswal 's wife and their conspiracy to kill him. Bhullar and Lateef passionately argue in the court & finally a guilty verdict is pronounced & given capital punishment. Now everyone insist Sameer to go upstairs with Hariya, presumably to be hanged to his death. Sameer mocks them saying that they are real criminals who hang people for their petty game. Lateef replies that entire trial has been recorded by CCTV, and that either way, he would be punished in this court or a real court. Fearing dear life, Sameer pulls out a gun & threatens everyone at gunpoint, takes the DVR of the CCTV and runs out of the house with everyone else in pursuit. Sameer manages to destroy the DVR, but in a hasty move, accidentally falls off the cliff to his death, thus serving poetic justice to his crime.

A few days later, Natasha visits their place, telling them that she is here to collect Sameer's phone which is her company's property. The film ends with everyone convincing Natasha to play their game.","['Drama', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']","An 80-year-old man with a penchant for real life games in a story about rights and wrongs.

One day, a young boy named Rana from Kottaipattinam becomes distraught and runs away from his family by jumping into a river, despite protest from his twin brother Sena, and washes up near Kalingapuri. He's raised by fishermen and in time becomes close friends with prince Veera Mahendran and is trained to be a heavily skilled warrior. When he's grown up Rana gains heavy respect from the subjects and is invited to see the labor force of Kalingapuri, consisting of war prisanors from Kottaipattinum. Rana proposes that they train the number of slaves in their kingdom to become warriors, which Veera's father, King Mahendran allows. Rana trains the slaves and over time they become a skilled force to conquer local kingdoms. As the ultimate prize, Rana suggests laying siege to Kottaipattinum as he's convinced the slaves now despise the kingdom that has abandoned them. Declaration of war is sent to king Rishikodaghan of Kottaipattinum and Rana leads the army of warrior slaves to the kingdom, however he strangely ceases fire and is invited into the kingdom by his old friend prince Sengodagan, son of the king. He also reunites with his childhood love interest princess Vandana, Sengodagan's sister. It turns out that Rana had plotted to free the war prisinors and had discussed this plan with them before the supposed war. Mahendran recieves word of Rana's treachery and swears revenge.Rana reunites with his sister Yamuna and their uncle, but is told that Sena has gone missing after a battle. Rana is shown around the kingdom and saves Rishikodaghan from an accident, so the king grants him a wish. Since Sengodagan had expressed feelings for Yamuni, despite being a woman of lower class, Rana requests their marriage to which Rishikodaghan accepts. However after the wedding the king disowns his son and revokes his privledge to the throne for not marrying a member of royalty, which Sengodagan tolerates. One night, an intruder breaks into the castle and attempts to kill Rishigodaghan, but his daughter stops the intruder whose revealed to be Rana. Rana is arrested for treason and Vandana wonders why her friend would try to hurt her father. Rana explains that his own father Kochadaiyaan was a powerful warrior and skilled general of Kottaipattinum's army and gained heavy respect from the people which made Rishikodagan jealous. One day, while escorting a shipment of horses and weapons many soldiers of the kingdom are ambushed by enemies from Kalingapuri. The enemy soldiers are defeated but not before shooting poisoned arrows into the food supply crates, leading to Kochadaiyaan's army falling sick. With no choice, he pleads with king Mahendran to keep his men alive which he agrees to, as slaves in his kingdom along with all of the horses and weapons.When Kochadaiyaan returns to Kottaipattinam he's unjustly charged with treason by Rishikodagan. He is punished with execution and his wife, Rana, Sena, and Yamuni's mother protest that he did what needed to be done to keep the kingdom's men alive but she's silenced. Rana hugs his father, as allowed by the king just before he's executed. Kochadaiyaan is beheaded before Rana's eyes, much to his horror. After telling the story Vandana becomes angered at her father's actions but finds that Rishikodaghan intends to get her an arranged marriage to prince Veera Mahendran to seal truce to the war between the kingdoms. Rana escapes from the dungeons and crashes the wedding the next day, speaking up against Rishikodaghan's actions. King Mahendran is outraged and his men begin to attack, and Rana summons the former slave army and the rest of Kottaipattinam's forces as defense. The two kingdoms clash and Kottaipattinam repel's Kalingapuri's army. Rana kills king Mahendran but spares his son in reminder of their friendship. He also finds Rishikodaghan and beheads him in revenge. Shortly after, he's confronted by his brother Sena who has returned, but is enraged that he killed the king their father taught them to protect.

She is an aspiring novelist and is researching for writing a horror story, whereas Kunal does not believe in supernatural powers, and is sceptical of anything supernatural. Nikki, keeps telling him that he would soon realize the presence of supernatural beings. At first, Kunal is confused and scared, and his fears are confirmed when he learns that his boss, i.e., the pizzeria owner Mr. Kapoor's pregnant wife is possessed by a spirit. Meanwhile, Nikki becomes pregnant.

One particular day, Kunal goes out to deliver a pizza to a customer and returns to the restaurant in a state of shock while covered in blood; he is apparently injured, keeps constantly muttering Nikkis name, and seems to be worried about her. When his boss questions him, Kunal explains that he had been to deliver a pizza to a customer named Smitha in a bungalow and recounts the events that happened at the bungalow. Smitha requests Kunal to wait downstairs while she goes upstairs to retrieve change. Almost immediately, there is power failure, which alarms Kunal. While waiting downstairs completely alone in the dark, Kunal hears a loud unidentifiable noise from the bedroom upstairs. Going up to investigate, he finds Smitha murdered suspiciously and notices one slice the pizza he had delivered to be missing, suggesting that there may be somebody else in the house. Horrified, Kunal makes a dash for the door only to realize that it has been locked from the outside. Further more when the murdered woman's husband arrives, he at first believes he stumbles upon his wife having an affair. Through his cellphone Kunal communicates with him and explains his situation thoroughly instigating Mr. Ghost to aid him on how to get out of the house. Moreover, Mr. Ghost suddenly disappears from the front entrance, and is found by Kunal inside the house mysteriously murdered in the same room as his wife, with two slices of the pizza now missing. Also, Kunal encounters the couple's child ""Anjali"", identical to the name of the spirit allegedly possessing Mr. Kapoor's wife. Kunal tries everything he can to get out of the house including trying to break down the sealed doors leading outside, to using the house phone which happens to work even though the line is dead. Kunal manages to contact Nikki using the phone and gets her to contact to the local police to come and rescue him. The door bell rings, and Kunal finds Nikki outside. He sees the ghost couple behind Nikki and asks her to move, but is attacked by the ghosts. When a couple of policemen arrive at the bungalow, Kunal believes that Nikki had requested them to help him, but they reveal that four people had been killed in that house - Smitha, Mr. Ghost, their young daughter and a girl named Nikki, implying that she is Kunal's girlfriend, Nikki. The police disclose that Kunal is a suspect regarding the murder case and attempt to arrest him. Confused and in tears, Kunal does not believe the policemen and attempts to escape the clutches of these police men in order to search for Nikki.

While trying to escape, Kunal witnesses the police getting dragged into the house and being killed. At this juncture, Kunal, in a horrified state, runs back to the restaurant. His friends at the restaurant and Mr. Kapoor visit the bungalow themselves and see Nikki apparently possessed by Anjali. Further, it is revealed that the bungalow had previously witnessed the untimely deaths of a married couple, their daughter, and two policeman, whose ghosts Kunal had earlier interacted with. Meanwhile, Kunal seems to continue his search for Nikki, has constant health issues, and seems to be disturbed by ghosts and supernatural entities.

As Kunal during a delivery stops and calls Nikki, the true story of what had happened is disclosed. The Income Tax department had planned on a raid at the restaurant owner Mr. Kapoor's house. Mr. Kapoor who has diamonds worth around 20 million hidden in his restaurant hides it in a box of candies and asks Kunal to deliver it to his house. but he goes his house first to deliver pizzas to his wife, she notices the candy box. She decides to take few candies, when she notices the packet containing diamonds. Kunal and Nikki decide that stealing those diamonds would improve their life style and support their baby. So, they concoct a clever story in which Kunal convincingly ""forgets"" the Pizza bag at the ""haunted"" bungalow which Mr. Kapoor would never enter into, thanks to his fear of supernatural powers. Meanwhile, Nikki packs and plans to go somewhere away from that city and decide to settle abroad. Kunal says that before going away from there he wants to deliver the last pizza of his life and gets a phone call.

Kunal, after the phone call, goes to deliver a pizza to a house and he encounters a series of events similar to the story he had narrated.

Chulbul has a troubled relationship with Prajapati and Makkhi. After 21 years, Chulbul becomes a cop and calls himself as Robin Hood Pandey, where he still lives with his family. Makkhi is in love with Nirmala, whose father Masterji opposes their relationship. Chulbul falls in love with a girl named Rajjo, whom he meets during a police chase culminating in an encounter.

A corrupt political leader named Chedi Singh meets Chulbul and both quickly become enemies. Makkhi asks Prajapati to arrange his marriage with Nirmala, but Prajapati refuses because he needs money to repay the loans he took to make his factory and believes that he can acquire money through his son marrying a rich girl. In desperate need of money, Makkhi steals some cash from Chulbul's cupboard and gives the stolen cash to Masterji, hoping that he will permit Makkhi to marry Nirmala.

Meanwhile, Chulbul proposes marriage to Rajjo, who rejects as she has to take care of her drunkard father Hariya. Chulbul arrives home to find his mother Naini Devi dead, where he goes to Prajapati to make peace as he is the only family left. However, Prajapati rejects and despises him as an outcast. Makkhi invites Chulbul to his marriage with Nirmala, where Chulbul convinces Hariya to marry Rajjo. Hariya commits suicide as he knows that Rajjo will not marry anyone while he is alive. Chulbul takes Rajjo to Makkhi's exuberant wedding. Realising that Makkhi has stolen his money to finance the wedding, Chulbul marries Rajjo in an impromptu ceremony.

Not wishing to aggravate the matter any further, Prajapati resolves the situation by accepting an apology. Chulbul meets a political leader named Dayal Sahu aka Dayal Babu, who also dislikes Chedi. With his help, Chulbul adulterates Chedi's breweries and wrongly frames him for it.

Enraged, Chedi burns Makkhi's factory where Prajapati suffers from a heart attack and is hospitalised. Makkhi goes to Chedi for help, where Chedi agrees to finance Prajapati's treatment if he delivers a crate of mangoes to Dayal Babu's house. Unbeknownst to Makkhi, Chedi has placed a bomb inside the crate, which explodes after he leaves, killing Dayal Babu. Chedi gives Makkhi a task to kill Chulbul. Makkhi accepts, but ends up confessing to Chulbul that Chedi made him plant the bomb unknowingly. Chulbul forgives him and reconciles with him. During a final confrontation between Chulbul and Chedi, Makkhi reveals to Chulbul that it was Chedi, who killed Naini.

Due to insufficient funds, he is unable to fulfill his dream. On the other hand, his girlfriend Tani got a scholarship to the US. Though he is happy with his girlfriend's achievement, he becomes depressed for not fulfilling his own dream. His friend Ricky tells him that he can get him into the college, but Lorry will have to smuggle drugs along with him. Lorry agrees and, at the airport, successfully passes the X-ray machine.

ACP Vishnu Kamath is a previously corrupt cop who had accepted a lot of bribes to satisfy his family. However, his family died in a car accident. Several years later, he is offered a job by the Chief Minister of Goa: to flush out all the drug dealers in Goa, which he accepts. His success leads to a panic among the drug suppliers. The drug dealers gather for a meeting led by Zoey Mendosa. Zoey guarantees them that their drugs will be in safe hands if they are given to a mysterious person named Michael Barbosa. Kamath decides to chase Michael Barbosa and finds out about Ricky.

When Kamath reaches Ricky, he is already dead. Kamath finds out about his cocaine-smuggling and his girlfriend, Rozanna. They reach the airport on the same day Lorry is about to leave. Kamath encounters Rozanna and finds a photo of Lorry in her phone. She is allowed to go due to a lack of evidence. Kamath then identifies Lorry as the person he had seen in Rozanna's phone. They detain him and find cocaine stuffed in his bag. Lorry is sent to juvenile jail, where his friend, DJ Joaquim ""Joki"" Fernandes, tries to get him out. It is then revealed that Zoey and Joki used to be in a relationship. Zoey wanted to be an air hostess, but failed. Joki introduced her to his boss, Lorsa Biscuita, a.k.a. the Biscuit, who had worldwide contacts. With the help of his contacts, Biscuit got her a job in the airlines, though she had to smuggle cocaine to international regions to repay him. She ended up getting caught and was sentenced to 14 years in jail. Biscuit's contact got her free in 14 days, but to repay him, she had to sleep with Biscuit. She broke up with Joki and made her life drug-dealing with Biscuit.

Joki meets Zoey, and the two end up sleeping together. Zoey gives him a video of Biscuit announcing that he is going to have a rave in neighboring Karnataka, out of Kamath's jurisdiction and that Michael Barbosa will be bringing and exchanging drugs. Joki gives this tape to Kamath. When Biscuit learns about Zoey and Joki, he kills Zoey. After recruiting Lorry for help, Kamath attacks Biscuit's party and arrests the drug dealers. When Kamath's colleague Rane asks him about Barbosa, Kamath says that he knows the secret of Barbosa, and Rane kills Kamath. It is revealed that Rane was always involved with Biscuit. Joki later finds out about Kamath's death and arrives at the crime scene, fitting together the pieces as Kamath has. Michael Barbosa is not a man, but a gravesite Biscuit uses for storing drugs. We see Joki carefully storing the bags of cocaine somewhere, then calling Rane to arrange a meeting. Lorry is now free of the charge, and he leaves jail. When Joki and Rane are going to meet Biscuit, Joki kills Rane, saying that he knows Rane is the person who killed Kamath. Kamath's body is being cremated in an electric furnace owned by Biscuit. We see that this is where Joki has put the drugs, and Biscuit arrives only too late. Having been brought down by the destruction of his stockpile, Biscuit is killed by a woman, possibly Rozanna.

1848771,Aarakshan,Drama Thriller reserv tion princip cowshed ching tions students sses minister college ckw school vice,Drama Thriller mentor decision establish caste-based reservations jobs education conflict teacher,"In 2008, Deepak Kumar  is at an interview for the teacher's post at an affluent school. The interviewers turn him down when they discover his low-caste roots. Deepak relates the incident to his mentor, Dr. Prabhakar Anand . Dr Anand, the legendary principal of renowned STM college, offers Deepak an interim job as a teacher at STM. Deepak is comforted by his friend, Sushant , and his girlfriend Poorbi , who is Dr. Anand's daughter.
The state minister, Baburam, wishes to enroll his no-good nephew at STM. Dr. Anand however, turns him down. The minister decides to install his own man, Mithilesh Singh , on the STM college board. Cunning and greedy, Mithilesh seeks only to enrich himself. The minister's grand ambition is to build a multi-billion educational conglomerate, and plans to use Mithilesh's outside business-a coaching class-for it.The Supreme Court grants reservations for Other Backward Classes. A large crowd of STM students, boisterously celebrating the ruling, arrive at the gates of STM and start a ruckus. Sushant gathers a group of upper-caste boys and tries to drive off the revelers. Sushant is pissed as he missed admission in his favored college because of the new reservation rules. Dr. Anand hauls Deepak and Sushant, but is shocked to find that Deepak has turned on him. Poorbi later confronts Deepak and orders him to apologize to her father, but he refuses, leading to their break-up.The backward classes welcome reservations because it provides additional opportunities for education. The upper classes are against reservations because they do not believe in a level-playing field. These arguments are played out between Sushant and Deepak. The moderate STM administrators are afraid that college-level reservations may create conflicts between the students. STM is a private institution but Anand has always supported the cause of the backward classes by providing them backdoor entry into STM by ignoring the board prescribed cut off percentages. When asked by a reporter, Dr. Anand shares his personal opinion - that some form of reservation, free of politics and economics, is good for society.The next day's headlines scream that Dr. Anand favors reservations. The STM board is outraged; Dr. Anand is warned that Mithilesh will use this to oust him as Anand's views on reservation might be construed as official STM policy. Dr. Anand resigns from STM, and Mithilesh is appointed as the new principal.
In an added twist, a few months ago Anand had allowed his dying ex-vice principals sons to stay in their house till they were able to get back on their feet. The ex-vice principal died . Then the sons sign a contract with Mithilesh to run coaching classes out of the premises for 2 yrs. Anand comes to know of this when he comes to stay in house after surrendering his official residence as the principal of STM. His attempts to throw Mithilesh out come to a naught. Eventually one of the STM teachers comes forward & gets Anand & his family to stay with them.Deepak returns from his PhD studies in the US & tries to use his Dalit political connections to get the house evicted from Mithilesh. However, Mithilesh uses his even bigger political connections to thwart Deepak. Deepak then attacks Mithilesh's coaching center, which Mithilesh manages to capture on live TV & gets Deepak & Anand arrested for hooliganism.Dr Anand resolves to take out Mithilesh with the only weapon left: teaching. He approaches his friend, Shambhu the cowherd, and takes shelter at the cowshed. He begins teaching small groups of needy and backward students from the nearby poor neighborhood, at the cowshed. His first success is Muniya , Shambhu's daughter who comes in first place at the board exam. Muniya's principal offers to send more students to Dr. Anand's cowshed school. Deepak and Sushant return to Dr. Anand and join forces, teaching at the cowshed school. The cowshed students fare much better at the exams than their classmates. The cowshed school's reputation grows and begins to draw away students at Mithilesh's coaching class.Mithilesh responds by obtaining a legal permit to demolish the cowshed. The situation is diffused by the arrival of Shakuntala Tai, the reclusive magnate who started the STM institutions. She calls the chief minister, who promptly averts the destruction of the cowshed. Mithilesh is dismissed, and Dr. Anand is installed as the chief trustee of the STM and lifelong principal of the newly created STM Remedial Center.","['Drama', 'Thriller']",The decision by India's supreme court to establish caste-based reservations for jobs in education causes conflict between a teacher and his mentor.,"Super 30,Chalk N Duster,Raajneeti,Satyameva Jayate 2,Aligarh,Article 15"

5080556,2.0,Action Sci-Fi Thriller kshi tion bird ins birds hum expl cell destroy council milit ture cre,Action Sci-Fi Thriller summons robot mobiles start mysteriously flying hands people trusted ward bird-shaped supernatural powers,"It has been eight years since the events of the first movie, Enthiran, in which Chitti is disassembled after his corruption. His creator, scientist Dr. Vaseegaran builds a female android named Nila  and shows her to a group of college students. Shortly after the presentation, one of the college student's cell phone starts to hover in midair, throwing him off his bike. When he tries to grab it, it displays a sparrow on the screen and takes flight into the upper atmosphere. The city of Chennai is thrown into chaos as each and every mobile device in it abruptly flies into the sky. A scientific council led by Home Minister S. Vijay Kumar discusses the nature of the phenomenon. Despite suggestions from the council, Vaseegaran finds it hard to believe the cause is another nation's technology nor alien forces. He explains that the phones are restricted to Chennai and have not crossed the troposphere. A phone company minister at the police station confirms that all the phones are switched off at once, the mass behaving like a hive.Phone retail store owner Jayanth Kumar is seen driving home with an enormous swarm of sentient phones following him. Before he goes to sleep he's interrupted by an audio of his employee telling him that the new shipment of phones they ordered after the chaos has arrived, in his household. The phone swarm reveals itself and traps Kumar in the room, displaying birds on their screens and enter his body, causing him to explode. Police arrive at his house the next day thoroughly confused by the nature of his death as there are no signs of human struggle. Nila and Vaseegaran find scattered minerals and electronic parts of mobile phones. It's revealed that hours before Kumar's murder, his shipment of phones were driven to the rest of the swarm and disappeared. Vaseegaran calls his girlfriend Sana to bait his phone to the rest of the swarm. Him and Nila follow the phone and track it's electromagnetic trail to a small village. They find the swarm active, which manifests as a giant bird's talon. Nila saves Vaseegaran from being killed and the swarm departs.At the council Vaseegaran heavily recommends reactivating his creation, Chitti, to combat the new threat. A member of the council, Dhinendra Bohra,strongly goes against Vaseegaran's plan and explains the destruction Chitti caused eight years prior when he was reprogrammed by his father, whom Chitti murdered. S. Vijay Kumar vetos the plan and decides to have military protection at cell shops and towers. Dhinendra blames Vaseegaran for his father's death and makes it clear that he won't forget. Telecom company owner Manoj Lula is angered at the situation impeding his buisness and complains to telecom minister Vaira Moorthy about it. Lula drives home but the swarm crashes his car and chases him into the forest, where it crushes him to death. The phones shape into a giant bird of prey and take flight.Moorthy is paranoid the next day and has military aid protecting his house. The swarm of phones assault the military at a cell phone tower construction zone and destroy all vehicles and structures. Not long after, Moorthy's phone breaks into the house and inserts itself into his body. Moorthy is admitted into the hospital and Vijay Kumar comes to see him. Moorthy is killed and his phone ruptures through his skin and escapes. A terrified Kumar calls up Vaseegaran and tells him to rebuild Chitti immediatly. It's revealed that Vaseegaran has already retrieved Chitti's old body from a technology museum and is upgrading him with new powers and abilities. Kumar explains that he will hold responsibility for Chitti's actions.The bird attacks the city the following day and dodges the military's defense. A newly built, stronger and faster Chitti battles the bird and leads it outside of town while driving an armored truck. He triggers an explosion when the bird eats the truck and destroys it. The phones now reform into a smaller bird and proceed to attack Chitti, who's low on battery. He crawls to the space station's generator and recharges, but the bird can't enter through the satellite antennae of the station and becomes shocked back. The bird retreats and Chitti shows Vaseegaran the data later. Chitti deduces the nature of the entity to be an aura, specifically a collected mass of negatively charged electrons. Chitti explains that the aura of a living animal will be positively charged and a deceased being will be negatively charged. A scientist at the space station states that they send positive charged signals to search for extraterrestrial life, meaning that the negative charged bird was incapable of entering the stream. Vaseegaran builds a photon synthesizer that emits positive signals at the target, hoping it will contain the entity. Upon analyzing footage of the attack, Vaseegaran sees that a human face shows up on the bird. Nila gives Vaseegaran information on all unusual cell phone related deaths that occurred recently. It turns out that a day before the phones developed this behavior, a man committed suicide just the day before at a cell tower.Vaseegaran, Nila, and Chitti drive the A.I.R.D bus carrying the synthesizer to the village where the phones rest. The bird comes to life and tries to destroy the machine, but Chitti guards it and the majority of the aura is contained in the device. The partially destroyed bird manifests as an egg and hatches into a humanoid figure. Vaseegaran recognizes him as the deceased ornithologist Pakshi Rajan. Chitti tries to convince him to stop attacking, but Pakshi refuses and tries to destroy the machine. Chitti asks why he's doing all this and what Pakshi has against humanity. Pakshi takes him to a dilapidated house, in which a flashback reveals that it was his home and sanctuary for a number of birds he cared for. He tells his student about how a sparrow revived him when he was born still, and since then he has been passionate for birds his whole life. But most recently, since the popularity of modern mobile phones the population of birds in India have been in decline. Pakshi recognizes that radiation from mobile devices is messing with bird's abilities to navigate and think, driving many individuals to insanity and sickness. He holds seminars and protests regarding this but is quickly dismissed and mocked for his concern. He talks to Lula about this, who kicks him out of his office for wasting his time, holding importance to his business and money. Pakshi's own friends turn on him as the demand for cell phone usage removes their land for business when they're unable to farm, with the decline of bird populations leading to overpopulating insects eating too much crops. Over time, one by one all the birds in Pakshi's sanctuary and in the wild, even newborn chicks suffer trauma and pain before death. A heartbroken Pakshi talks to Moorthy and angrily accuses him of the events that have occurred, that there's no reason to hold the lives of birds below humanity when they're the reason for their society's existence. Moorthy retaliates stating that they follow their laws and uphold their business, despite Pakshi previously realizing that the companies have increased radiation standards illegally to increase profit and consumers. Pakshi files a court case but the companies turn their radiation down just before inspection and the case is denied. Pakshi becomes distraught and cries at his bird's graves. He becomes bitter and fantasized murdering every ignorant person who has killed the majority of birds through their hobbies. He becomes depressed and hangs himself at a phone tower. His spirit is awoken by the radiation emitted from the tower and absorbs the souls of all the deceased birds in the city, also absorbing their pain. His spirit transforms into a vengeful aura overwhelmed by grief and begins going on killing sprees against the public.After listening, Chitti sympathizes with Pakshi's pain but explains that killing all those people won't change anything. Pakshi states that the people are too ignorant and careless to understand how their usage of technology is destroying the nature around them. He vows to kill every human whom has contributed, but before he can escape Vaseegaran traps his soul in the neutralization device. Vaseegaran, Chitti, and Nila are applauded by the council for their heroic efforts and an issue is placed by Kumar that an army of 500 Chittis will be donated to the military to protect the nation. Dhinendra becomes jealous of Chitti's victory and breaks into Vaseegaran's lab to release Pakshi's spirit. Pakshi regains control over the phones and possesses Vaseegaran to prevent Chitti from thwarting him. Pakshi, now in his human form has superhuman strength and starts killing people in the city again. Chitti refrains from stopping his own creator and Pakshi dismembers him. Nila breaks into the police station and upgrades Chitti to his 2.0 evil alter ego who won't hesitate to kill Vaseegaran if he has too.Pakshi imprisons eighty thousand people at a soccer stadium and kills Dhinendra, who was present at the game by dousing him in radiation. Chitti breaks into the stadium and summons his army. He and Pakshi shapeshift and battle furiously, but when Chitti is depowered, Pakshi creates several bird drones to tear his army apart. Before he can destroy Chitti, a microbot of Chitti's creation named Kutti interrupts him. He and hundreds of Kuttis, mounted on doves threaten to hurt them if Pakshi doesn't stand down. They self destruct and destroy the drones. After Chitti shoots Vaseegaran, Pakshi leaves his body. The Kutti bots lead Pakshi to the space station and trap him in the signal streams, where Chitti overwhelms him with positive charge and destroys his aura. Vaseegaran recovers in the hospital and explains to a visiting Kumar that Pakshi's violence was wrong but his words were true, and that humanity had no right to bathe in the luxuries of the world at the cost of animal's lives. If they remain careless both nature and technology will turn on them like Pakshi has. Kumar puts forth an order to protect what remains of the bird populations and Chitti starts a relationship with Nila.In the end credits, Vaseegaran's phone transforms into a Kutti bot who enthusiastically greets him.","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Thriller']","After mobiles start mysteriously flying out of the hands of people in Chennai, Dr Vaseegaran summons his trusted robot Chitti to ward off the bird-shaped supernatural powers of Pakshirajan.","Krrish 3,Monica O My Darling,Brahmastra Part One: Shiva,Mr. X,Drishyam 2,Roar: Tigers of the Sundarbans"

Siddharth lures Dhanna with the same deal as Panna and takes him to the same ruin and starts torturing him.To torture them further, he attached a bucket with a rat in it to their body. With the bloody brutality that unfolded at the fort, Siddharth started to live in Panna's house as a tenant, lying to Chetna that her husband wished for it.

As they made love, Dhanna managed to free himself and escape from the fort though because of immense blood loss, he collapsed on the ground.The next morning, Siddharth dragged Dhanna's body back inside, but he noticed a little boy witnessing the whole incident.

Panna, Kanwar, and Dhanna, had entered Siddharth's house in Delhi after being called by Suva. Suva worked there, and he called his friends to steal the valuables from the house, though they were interrupted when his wife Cheryl  entered. Startled by the sudden emergence of the wife, the four men grabbed hold of her, but what followed was inhuman torture. They forced themselves on his wife and mutilated her body. When Siddharth entered the house, he saw his wife lying lifeless on the floor. Her face was unrecognizable from the hours of torture by the beastly men. That was when he decided to seek revenge. He had a diary in which he planned in detail the way he would carry out his revenge plan. The police found the diary in his room  and noticed that he had mentioned a fort for the execution of the plan, so the police tracked it down.
Meanwhile Siddharth had told Chetna that he was leaving, and she decided to go with him.

As he reached the fort, he found Siddharth burning the body of Panna in front of Chetna. He shared with her the shameful deeds of her husband. When Surekha asked him to give up, Chetna shot Siddharth in the chest. The revenge had finally come to an end.
After 6 months, we are told that Chetna is pregnant with Siddharth's child. Even though he died, the brutal incident will forever remain etched in her heart as she now carries his child. Chetna was not arrested by the police since all those who acted against the law were killed.

11260832,Bellbottom,Action Thriller Minister terrorists hijackers flight Prime demands plane ministers airport,Action Thriller hostages commercial rescuing airliner hijacked terrorists government agent tasked,"In 1984, Indian Airlines Flight 691  is hijacked, the seventh such hijacking in India in five years, with all the previous ones ending in acquiescence to the hijackers' demands that other terrorists be freed and money be delivered. During her briefing, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, frustrated at the lack of action taken on the matter, decides to allow a RAW agent code-named ""Bell Bottom"" to handle the case. As a ""mere"" clerk, he is already viewed with consternation by the other officials, and his deduction that the alleged masterminds, a Khalistan separatist group named ""Azaadi Dal"" , are merely a front for Pakistan's ISI are rebuffed by them due to improving Indo-Pakistani relations. After the plane lands in Amritsar when he predicted it would land in Lahore, he is dismissed. However, his supervisor points out that he is an expert on hijackings and is motivated by personal experience.

In 1979, polymath Anshul Malhotra lives with his mother Raavi, an asthmatic who constantly visits his brother in London, and his wife Radhika. Her flight is hijacked by terrorists, but then-PM Morarji Desai and Pakistani President Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq negotiate and fulfill the hijackers demands in exchange for the hostages' release. However, Raavi dies, reportedly due to natural causes. Soon after, though, Anshul is abducted by RAW, who reveal that one of the hijackers, Daljeet ""Doddy"" Singh, had purposely withheld her inhaler, pusher her into the galley and thrown heavy blankets on her, increasing her suffering as she died. Anshul is given the offer to join RAW; he accepts and takes on the code-name Bell Bottom, with his cover to his wife being that he is an embassy officer. After his training, which showcases his extraordinary memory and improves his previously subpar physical skills, he is assigned to the hijacking desk. In 1983, he finds one of the hijackers while visiting his brother in London and tracks them; he raids their house with other RAW agents and captures three of them but the fourth, Doddy Singh, escapes.

Back in the present, the plane takes off from Amritsar and lands in Lahore, prompting Gandhi to order Anshul back in. He convinces her to ""break script"" and disallow the Pakistani side to send their negotiating team, and orders them not to refuel the plane. In response, Zia sends his minister to keep track of the situation. In Lahore, the minister replaces the hijacker with Doddy and supplies weapons and explosives. Correctly figuring that they will go to the Middle East to take advantage of their naivety in aerial terrorism, Anshul prepares for a covert operation in Dubai against the Indian ministers' wishes. Meanwhile, the Pakistani minister goes to Dubai to observe what is going on and guide Doddy.

Upon arrival, Anshul and his team, disguised as diplomatic aides, meet up with a contact in the Dubai airport, where they see Dubai's emphasis on humanitarianism and avoidance of bloodshed. Their first plan, covertly entering the aircraft and disarming the hijackers, is foiled when the Pakistani minister notices and closes the luggage door. Anshul's ""plan B"", sending in the Indian army, is also curtailed when the Dubai officials are notified and the ship they are on is denied entry. With all avenues cut off, the ministers go to negiotate; although they agree to the terrorists' demands of money, more terrorist releases, and a charter flight to London for freedom, they are surprised at the terrorists extreme inhumanity and one of them is taken hostage as a ""VIP"" target to be held until they get to London. Seemingly out of options, Anshul asks their airport contact to take them to an under-construction terminal so they can view the proceedings; however this is a ruse as Anshul reveals his knowledge of the contact's betrayal and ties her up. Disguising themselves as airport workers, they take advantage of a sandstorm to get on the field, free the VIPs, and capture the terrorists, redirecting the charter flight to India. The leader of Dubai denies them take off clearance at first, but after Anshul explains how their methods fit in with Dubai's humanism, he grants it. In India, the terrorists are booked, with Zia and the ISI leaders huffing in disgrace, and the flight is returned, with all on board safe and sound and reunited with their families. In the end, it is revealed that Radhika was actually working for RAW and had informed them of her husband's abilities and background in the first place.","['Action', 'Thriller']","When an Indian commercial airliner is hijacked by terrorists in the mid 1980s, a government agent is tasked with rescuing the 210 hostages.","Pathaan,Chor Nikal Ke Bhaga,India&apos;s Most Wanted,Romeo Akbar Walter,Sooryavanshi,Baby"

On one such trek he meets the beautiful Olga , a student from Bulgaria and saves her from an avalanche. They eventually fall in love. Olga becomes pregnant. He implores her to remain in India with him, but despite her love for Shivaay, Olga does not want the child. She wants to return to Bulgaria and asks Shivaay to return with her, but he cannot adapt to that life. He begs her to give him the child after which he will not stop her. Olga has a beautiful daughter, Gaura , who looks just like her mother, and asks Shivaay to tell the daughter that her mother passed away, and leaves India forever.Eight years later Shivaay leads a happy life with Gaura in the mountains. There is a turn when Gaura discovers her mother's last letter and confronts Shivaay and insists to be taken to Bulgaria. Shivaay and Gaura arrive in Sofia and begin looking for Olga. During this time Shivaay discovers that young children are being trafficked through Bulgaria. He saves one young child, and this is reported in the press. Shivaay requests the Indian embassy for help in tracing Olga and is assigned to Anu , an eager young officer at the embassy. The traffickers, led by the baron Ustinov and his right-hand man, the unseen Changez, come after Shivaay and kidnap Gaura. Shivaay chases the van destroying various cars and causing the unintentional death of a police officer in the process. He loses the van and is arrested by the Bulgarian police and charged with murder and trafficking. The latter charge is applied because he was never married to Olga and the police therefore refuse to believe that Gaura, who is fair skinned, is his own daughter.Shivaay breaks out of the police transport killing another officer in the process and reaches Anu who advises him to surrender. The other embassy officer explains that the trafficking trade is worth billions and is operated by very dangerous men with deep police and political connections. Shivaay meets Anu privately, but she alerts the cops and Shivaay is nearly arrested again. He escapes and disappears into the streets. He visits various slums and brothels asking about his daughter and ends up busting open a small flesh trade den and liberating many young children. Anu is shocked at Shivaay's rage until her own father explains that they are merely the actions of a desperate father. When Shivaay brings one of the saved prostitutes to Anu's home and asks Anu to help her out, Anu has a complete change of heart and agrees to help Shivaay locate his daughter even if it means going outside legal limits.Anu and Shivaay seek the help of Anu's wannabe boyfriend and computer hacker Wahab  to recover CCTV footage of Shivaay's various chases. Shivaay can identify Ivanovich and, through Wahab's computer hacking, is able to lure Ivanovich to a trap. After a vicious fight, Ivanovich reveals Ustinov's location and the reference to Changez. Olga, having now seen television coverage of Shivaay, meets Shivaay and joins the quest to find Gaura. Arriving at Ustinov's mountain lodge, Shivaay finds Ustinov dead, and finds the bodies of various children, who were victims of the organ trade, in the basement. He discovers that Gaura has been taken away to Romania to be sold into the flesh trade. Shivaay deduces that Changez must be a dirty cop: only a cop would be able to trace the CCTV computer download and thus beat Shivaay to the Ustinov cabin.Shivaay chases after the transport van carrying his daughter off to Romania. He uses his advanced mountain skills to scale the Balkan Mountains near Vidin-Calafat and stop the van. A prolonged and vicious fight ensues as Changez, now revealed to be Captain Nikolai of the Bulgarian Police, attacks Shivaay. After a savage hand-to-hand fight, Shivaay kills Changez with a three-pronged ice stalactite. Gaura is reunited with Olga who is now married to a wealthy Bulgarian and can provide Gaura with every comfort. Shivaay is devastated at the prospect of losing Gaura, but seeing as Olga now beseeches him, he leaves for the airport with a heavy heart. The film ends as Gaura runs into Shivaay's arms and rips up his tickets before he boards the plane.","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Crime', 'Drama', 'Thriller']",A skilled mountaineer races against time to rescue his mute daughter from the clutches of human traffickers in Bulgaria.,"Kaali Khuhi,Rowdy Rathore,Mardaani,Drishyam,Boss,Love Hostel"
20319598,Lakadbaggha,Action Comedy Crime Fantasy Thriller n’t vigilante local hyena arts masked police goons men Working fact trafficking meat Colonel kill,Action Comedy Crime Fantasy Thriller port Lakadbaggha vigilante unearths animal Hyena loving fact underground illegal trade cell functions Indian Striped investigating chances rare,"Arjun Bakshi loves dogs more than anything else in the world. Working at a local courier service, his physical stature might not reveal that he teaches martial arts to kids. Another incredible fact about him is that the police are looking for him. Actually, they are after a masked vigilante who is taking down local goons one by one. They aren’t aware that their suspect is, in fact, Arjun, who doesn’t kill the goons but maims them and leaves them to be caught by the police. Why is he in the vigilante business? Well, the goons that he attacks are involved in dog trafficking, stuffing the poor animals with drugs and smuggling them offshore. It’s quite an unheard-of and brutal new way of trafficking drugs, but apparently, dog-meat consumption is also a secondary way for these traffickers to make money for a mysterious kingpin. But Arjun is not even aware of the heinous crime. He only cares about saving his beloved dogs from the people who mean them harm; he knows the world is full of animal abusers.

Akshara D’Souza, a crime branch officer, has been appointed to the case of finding this masked vigilante who is taking the law into their own hands. She gets handed her divorce papers by Arjun, who comes to the station in the capacity of a delivery boy but sees the walls are riddled with information about the masked vigilante. The cases of missing dogs keep rising, which means that Arjun isn’t going to retire from vigilantism any time soon, even though he knows that the police might be on to him. One day, Arjun isn’t able to locate a stray dog named Shonku and goes on to search for him on the streets of Kolkata. Luckily, Akshara notices Arjun and recognizes him as the delivery boy. She helps him file a missing dog report at the local police station after seeing his passion for dogs. In a sheer case of dramatic irony, Arjun’s intense love for dogs makes Akshara grow friendly toward him. She goes on a date with him and even spends time at his house, even though she is scared of off-leash dogs. While she is unaware that Arjun is the vigilante she is after, Arjun is unaware that Akshara’s brother Aryan is the abominable trafficker responsible for the disappearance of the stray dogs.Arjun is a vigilante, for sure, but he is not the detective kind. He isn’t someone who would try to figure out the sinister reason behind the dogs’ disappearances. There is a rumor that people sometimes use dog meat in local cuisines, but most of it is hearsay. Arjun’s boss, Dutta Uncle, told him not to worry about the rumors and not to take the dog-lover stuff too seriously, but fate ensured that Arjun would get further sucked into the vigilante life. When a delivery from “Claws and Fangs Pet Shop” goes wrong, he beats up the suppliers for negligent and inhumane treatment of pet dogs in their facility. He didn’t know that the shop was part of a chain of pet shops that was owned by Aryan. The men were actually goons working for him, and when Arjun came to beat them up, they were transporting a hyena, which attacked the men, but Arjun was able to rescue it.

Aryan wasn’t too bothered the vigilante when he had previously disrupted his operations. The hyena was a special assignment, though. It was to be smuggled straight to Dubai for Mr. Gandhi, who was a local politician and had the power to help Aryan get the license for Khidirpur Dock, which would make the trafficking totally hassle-free. Arjun had inadvertently stopped this transaction, which infuriated the otherwise calm and composed Aryan. Arjun even found out that the rumors behind dog meat being used in local cuisines were actually true, and the same racket that was transporting the hyena was behind the illegal meat trafficking as well. Shonku was a victim of the racket, and Arjun vowed to get to the bottom of it all.Arjun didn’t even know who he was fighting. Aryan was probably waiting for his sister, who was completely in the dark about her brother’s criminal racket, to catch the vigilante before he had to send his men to find and kill him. The common link between Arjun and Aryan is Akshara. It so happens that Aryan runs a dog competition where Arjun wants to participate, entering his pet dog named Colonel into the competition, but because Indian breeds aren’t allowed, he isn’t let in. Akshara tries to cheer Arjun up and gets him a dinner meeting with Aryan, and he agrees to hear Arjun’s case for letting his dog compete.

The criminal, and the vigilante both sit at the same dinner table, unaware of each other’s secret reality. The cop too is totally oblivious to the truth. The dinner commences and Aryan declines Arjun’s request to let his dog participate in the competition. Arjun gets a clear sense that Aryan is not a good man as he believes that dogs don’t have souls, which is why he shot the dog that bit Akshara as a child. Aryan was running out of time to deliver the hyena to Mr. Gandhi, and he was getting desperate, which is why he killed his own men who had failed to locate the hyena. He employs his assassin girlfriend on the job, who starts to threaten the well-being of stray dogs to lure in the masked vigilante and Arjun doesn’t disappoint. He fights her but eventually gets knocked out, and Aryan finally gets to know the face behind the mask. His girlfriend abducts Arjun’s pet dog, Colonel, in order to make Arjun disclose the hyena’s location. Arjun shows up at a compound, fights Aryan and his men, and with the hyena’s help, kills all of them.

5502766,Phillauri,Comedy Drama Fantasy Musical Romance Mehreen Pirzada bro tree village poetry love songs poems married record spirit woman return,Comedy Drama Fantasy Musical Romance man tree love-life marry ward threats turns spirit bargained,"A young man Kanan  returns to India from Canada to marry his long-term girlfriend Anu , but comes to know that as he is a Manglik  he has to get married to a tree before getting married to her. He very reluctantly marries the tree, which is duly chopped down after the completion of the ceremony. As a result, from that day on-wards he is haunted by the spirit of a woman named Shashi , who lived in that particular tree and hence claims to now be 'married' to him.The story of Phillauri and Shashi is slowly revealed via the latter's flashbacks. Back in an unspecified time period, Shashi is a bright young woman who never fails to read the works of a poet named Phillauri that is regularly published in a local daily. Everyone in the village of Phillaur knows that the poems are written by the singer Roop Lal 'Phillauri' , who is the heart-throb of the village. However Roop Lal notices that Shashi, unlike all the other village girls, never comes to hear him sing. When he confronts her one day and tells her that he is the Phillauri who writes the poetry by narrating one of his famous poems to her, he is shocked when Shashi slaps and insults him. She asks him to use his talent - of being able to connect with the common man through his songs - for something important  and not for frivolous matters. From that day on-wards Roop Lal is a changed man, dedicating his life to knowing and understanding the poetry of Phillauri , and spreading its message via his beautiful singing to others.On one particular night while Roop Lal is alone at home singing one of Phillauri's poems, Shashi comes to him and reveals that she is the one who writes poetry under the pseudonym of 'Phillauri' . Subsequently love blossoms between the two , but Shashi's elder brother  eventually comes to know about the affair and intervenes between the lovers. Roop Lal confronts Shashi's brother and admits to having been an alcohol-addicted good-for-nothing who still is not worthy of her, but tells him that he  is going to Amritsar to record all the songs written by Shashi and will eventually return and ask for her hand in marriage.
The very fact that Shashi writes poetry is a revelation to her brother, and as time passes he too reads the poems and starts appreciating her obvious talent. Meanwhile Roop Lal records the songs in Amritsar  and is paid a handsome fee of three hundred rupees. He immediately sends the entire amount as a money order to Shashi's brother, along with a letter stating his intention to return and marry her on Baisakhi. Shashi's brother, by now convinced of Roop Lal's changed nature and good intentions as well as the deep love between the couple, starts the preparations for her marriage.On the day of the wedding Shashi comes to know that she is pregnant, but does not disclose the news to anyone except her close friend Amrit . She expectantly waits for Roop Lal along with all her relatives and the entire village, but eventually the day ends with him nowhere to be seen on any of the buses from Amritsar. Her brother has to face the intense embarrassment and shame of sending everyone away, and this in turn hurts Shashi so much that she commits suicide  due to an overwhelming sense of sadness, despair and betrayal.
In the midst of all these flashbacks by Shashi's spirit the parallel story-line in the present continues with Kanan , ending up in trouble with Anu who feels that he is not really interested in marrying her . In order to clear the misunderstanding Shashi finally manages to reveal her presence to Anu as well , and having heard her entire painful story Anu realizes that Shashi's spirit is in fact still stuck on the mortal plane due to her unfulfilled love. At that point Anu's grandmother happens to play her favorite record, which as fate would have it is the one Roop Lal recorded. The record label mentions the recording date as 13 April 1919, which results in an epiphany for Kanan who immediately takes Anu  to the site of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, which took place on that very day 98 years ago.The movie ends with Shashi's spirit reuniting finally with her lover Roop Lal's . Before they both ascend to heaven Shashi tells Kanan and Anu  to love and cherish each other always, and that is what they promise each other as they embark on a new phase of their very own love story.","['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Musical', 'Romance']","A man must marry a tree to ward off threats to his love-life, but the tree turns out to have more spirit than the man bargained for.","Teri Meri Kahaani,Ek Paheli Leela,Aa Bhi Ja O Piya,Kyaa Kool Hain Hum 3,Housefull,Rowdy Rathore"

Sunny has a crush on Goldie's daughter Twinkle, and the father is furious about it. Sunny's friend Pappi regularly gets magazines with porn stories and both enjoy reading them. Both are alone at home when Pappi reads out the latest edition of the magazine to Sunny in the room where Darshan is resting. As fate would have it, Darshan wakes up from coma listening to the porn story, and the name of the central character ""Bimla"" sticks in her mind. However, she falls unconscious again. Later when the doctor examines her, he tells them that she would soon regain her consciousness but her mind is in a very weak state, and thus, they must ensure that they don't do anything to dishearten her.

Everyone quickly starts working on a changeover of the look of the house to the 80s as that's when Darshan went into the coma. The biggest hurdle is that Sunil will have to convince Priya to return home. Sunil pleads her to return and on the insistence of her aunt, she agrees. Here, Sunil has asked his children to pose as househelps.

The two meet in a train, where Shaina reveals she had an ex-boyfriend Devi Lal Singh, and talks about her crazy experiences with him. Devi is shown to be intelligent and adventurous, always looking for a kick in his life. Shaina was helping her friend, Vidhi elope with Devi's friend, Jignesh, when she met Devi in Delhi. After a long, hilarious chase, Devi got Vidhi and Jignesh married in a temple, but also helped Vidhi's mother reach the temple for a ""kick"".

On her suggestion and getting ashamed from her father, Devi got a job in a chemical lab but resigned soon, suffering from the lack of a ""kick"". Devi tried hiding from Shaina that he is jobless again but she soon discovered it. Shaina scolded him for not being able to earn money, and Devi broke up with her and said that his new ""kick"" is now to earn money. She has since shifted to Warsaw, having to entertain Brijesh and his desire to see her married.

Himanshu shares his experiences with a thief he hates as he cannot stop him; the robber, Devil, has been targeting the rich people associated with corrupt businessman Shiv Gajra, and is robbing them.

On 15 November, Devi joins the police force. He arrives at the police station and stands in front of Himanshu, who is unable to do anything about the situation, therefore completing his challenge.

6986710,The Accidental Prime Minister,Biography Drama Prime Minister Accident hul nts Fin chief nce electi Bih,Biography Drama Prime Minister tenure country kind control cabinet,"Based on the memoir by Indian policy analyst Sanjaya Baru , The Accidental Prime Minister explores Manmohan Singh's  tenure as the Prime Minister of India from 2004 to 2014, and the kind of control he had over his cabinet and the country.Congress won the 2004 election under the leadership of Sonia Gandhi . But the BJP is not OK with India having a foreign national as a Prime Minister. Rahul  is against having Sonia as PM as he is afraid of assassination attempts. Priyanka  is neutral.
Sonia decides to step down from the nomination of PM and suggests Manmohan Singh instead. Pranab Mukherjee  is not happy as he thought he was in line for the honor. Lal Krishna Advani  admits that this was a masterstroke.From the beginning there is tension as Manmohan wants to handle Finance ministry, but Chidambram  wants the post for himself. Sonia intervenes from the beginning and gives Finance to Chidambram. Ahmed Patel  is Sonia's chief secy and believes that Sonia won the election and she selected Manmohan. Kapil Sibal  is the law minister and warns about constitutional precedence. Ahmed and Pranab decide to set up a National Advisory Committee, who will decide policy and issue instructions to the Govt. They install Gandhi loyalist Pulok Chatterji  as Manmohan's chief bureaucrat in PMO.To counter this and to bring his message directly to the nation, Manmohan requests Sanjay Baru to become his press secy. JN "" Mani"" Dixit  , T. K. A. Nair   and MK Narayanan   didn't like Sanjay's proximity to the PM. Sanjay also advised PM on who was leaking stories to the media like Jairam Ramesh who was on the NAC.Meanwhile left supporters like Sitaram Yechury  were not happy since PM wanted private company CEO's on the planning commission. LK Advani is angry when he thinks he was not accorded proper respect as per protocol, when he met the PM. He also rebuffs Naveen Patnaik  CM Orissa, when he comes asking for a special package for Bihar. Manmohan starts working on his signature legacy, the nuclear deal with the US.PV Narasimha Rao  dies & Sonia wants to bury him in Hyderabad, instead of in Rajghat. Meanwhile Ahmed Patel warns PM to abandon the nuclear deal, since Left will withdraw support if that happens. At this moment Atal Bihari Vajpayee  and the BJP support Manmohan as they firmly believe that the deal is in interest of the nation. Manmohan dares left to leave the government. Sonia again intervenes and asks Manmohan to reconsider. Manmohan resigns & sticks to his demand that Sonia cannot compromise with the left parties and embarrass the govt on world stage. Left withdraws support.But Amar Singh , leader of SP, is in US & speaks to APJ Abdul Kalam  about the deal and its importance to the nation. APJ certifies the deal and Amar Singh decides to support the UPA Govt.
In 2009, Sonia's relations with Manmohan deteriorates, and Sanjay resigns to take the blame. He comes back when Manmohan has a heart attack. He advises Manmohan to fight elections directly, since he believes COngress is playing it safe. If it wins, its because of Rahul, if it loses then its because of Manmohan. Manmohan campaigns and helps Congress win 206 seats. But the party credits Rahul. Manmohan wanted to tackle the Kashmir problem in his 2nd term, but was unsure of when he would be unseated by Rahul on the PM seat.Manmohan meets Pakistan Prime Minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani  in Egypt and agrees to go soft on Balochistan. Sonia is angered by this and uses this as an excuse to push Manmohan out of PMO. Manmohan elevates Sanjay to Principal Secy, but the news is leaked to press and Ahmed nixes the appointment. Then the scams start coming out in the news.
Now Sonia changes tacks and wants Manmohan to continue as the environment is not conducive to a change. Manmohan wants to resign, but is rebuffed. In 2013, he brings an ordinance to criminalize corruption, which even Rahul tears apart in a live press conference. Sanjay advises Manmohan to resign.... As a compromise Manmohan announces his desire not to be appointed as PM for a 3rd term, if UPA comes back to power.Sanjay writes a book on Manmohan which is released during the elections. The PMO denies the authenticity of the book and it ends up being a best seller. But Sanjay loses Manmohan as a friend, since he squarely put all the blame on the Gandhi family.","['Biography', 'Drama']",Explores Manmohan Singh's tenure as the Prime Minister of India and the kind of control he had over the cabinet and the country.,"PM Narendra Modi,Raajneeti,Satyameva Jayate 2,Rann,Dasvi,Satyagraha"

However, Chinese authorities get wind of this through a mole in the Indian embassy. In order to have a low-key presence the R&AW uses a grocery store as their outpost to execute and coordinate operations.

In the post Covid-19 era, rumours are rife that an even deadlier new virus has started spreading on the Indo-China border. The Indian Ambassador to UK Nirupama Datta  is under immense pressure to keep the news under wraps lest UK’s M16 gets involved. Undercover RAW agent Biren Ghosh  has managed to contact a Chinese ‘source.’ He intends to present the source at a conference in London as evidence of China’s latest misdemeanour. Just seven days before the conference, Biren goes missing. A day later, his body is fished out of the Thames. It is obvious that info about Biren and his mission had been leaked to the Chinese intelligence agency, MSS.With Biren dead, the team of RAW agents on the mission are faced with two questions: Who is Biren’s source? And who is the mole amongst them? They have six days in hand, and only one clue; a Chinese painting left behind by Biren for Uma , who heads the mission.To make matters more difficult, the team has strict instructions from New Delhi to keep the British intelligence out of it. And therefore, they must avoid fireworks. Everything has to be low-key. The mission in London must be kept confidential!

Thus begins the cat and mouse game, where no one is above suspicion.

At the debrief back at the agency, Luthra reveals that Jim was a former RAW agent and Kabir Dhaliwal's partner. Jim was awarded with the Vir Puraskar for his bravery after the agency could not find his body when Somalian terrorists killed his wife and unborn child . He had apparently faked his death in order to seek vengeance against the agency and country for not saving his family.Meanwhile, Pathaan learns about the code-word dubbed ""Raktbeej"" and also that the dead people in Dubai were ex-agents and their money was transferred from the account of Rubina ""Rubai"" Mohsin , a Pakistani doctor in Spain. He travels to Spain and is captured by Jim's men, where he also learns that Rubai is an ex-ISI agent who works for JIm. Jim wants to recruit Pathaan into the Outfit X, but he refuses. Jim argues that they work on choice assignments and are paid handsomely.
When Jim leaves his hideout, Rubai attacks Jim's men and escapes with Pathaan. Rubai is hit in the abdomen and Pathaan saves her. Rubai reveals that Raktbeej is in Moscow , where they travel to steal it before Jim does. The raktbeej is stored in the world's most secure vault with elaborate security measures. They fall in love with each other, trading stories of their past and how they came into the spy profession. Pathaan devices a plan to break into the vault and succeeds.
However, Rubai betrays Pathaan and has him captured by the Russian police who converge at the vault, as Rubai escapes with the Raktbeej. It is revealed that Jim used Rubai to make Pathaan steal the Raktbeej for himself. Pathaan is captured   and taken to prison by train, but is saved by Avinash ""Tiger"" Singh Rathore .Three years later, Pathaan travels to Africa and captures Jim's henchman Raafe . He is tracking Rubai. Pathaan abducts Raafe from an arms market and flies off in an helicopter after a brutal fight with the arm seller. Pathaan meets Nandini and reveals about Jim purchasing two saber missiles, while Nandini reveals Rubai's location in Paris .
Pathaan meets Rubai , who reveals that the Raktbeej is a mutated smallpox virus , which was forcibly developed by a captive Dr. Sahani under Jim's orders. She also expresses guilt about betraying Pathaan without knowing that her country would plan such an heinous attack . The virus is effective only for a few hrs and thus no risk of global contagion. It will only devastate Indian cities against which it will be launched via missiles.
They travel to Jim's lab in Siberia  and manage to recover one orb containing the virus with great difficulty, while Jim escapes with the other orb. Luthra and Nandini reach Jim's lab to take the orb back to the Indian Institute of Contagious Diseases , in India in order to develop a vaccine. Luthra also has Rubai arrested for having questionable loyalties.At the IICD in India, Dr. Farooqui demonstrates the orb to Nandini. Jim calls them and reveals that the orb has already spread the virus in the facility. The infected scientists, along with Nandini die in the facility by shooting themselves, to curb the spread of the virus. Later, the facility is destroyed in a controlled blast. Jim provides an ultimatum to evacuate Indian soldiers out of Kashmir within 24 hours else he will launch the virus against an Indian city via his missile. Pathaan interrogates Raafe about the location of the missile, and learns that the missile is situated in Afghanistan. After rescuing Rubai, they lure Jim's associates into a trap, and attack Jim's base. Qadir is killed by Rubai before activating the missile containing the virus. Pathaan chases after Jim with a jet-pack and they both crash land into a cabin.Meanwhile, Rubai deactivates the missile, but finds that Raktbeej is not in the missile, but instead in a passenger-bound airplane, which is about to land in Delhi. She informs Pathaan, who finds that Jim has the detonator. Luthra calls the air traffic control to prevent the plane from landing in Delhi. In the cabin, Pathaan and Jim fight brutally, resulting in the cabin begin sliding off a cliff. Despite getting stabbed by Jim, Pathaan steals the detonator, deactivates Raktbeej and throws Jim out of the cabin as the foundation is about to break. While Jim holds onto a plank, Pathaan takes away his Vir Puraskar, deeming him unworthy of it. He stomps and breaks the plank Jim was holding onto, resulting in him falling to his apparent death. Afterwards, Pathaan is reinstated into RAW and made as the head of JOCR, while Nandini is posthumously awarded with the Vir Puraskar for her bravery.In a mid-credits scene, Pathaan and Tiger are seen pondering about retiring and suggesting young agents who can replace them, but eventually decide to keep fighting the threats themselves.","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Thriller']","An Indian agent races against a doomsday clock as a ruthless mercenary, with a bitter vendetta, mounts an apocalyptic attack against the country.","Sooryavanshi,War,Romeo Akbar Walter,India&apos;s Most Wanted,Bellbottom,Baby"

However, in the fight, the liquid ended up on the bad man's own face instead. It served him right! Even though Akira was brave and did the right thing, she got into trouble. The police thought she did something wrong and she was sent to a special place for young people who are waiting for their cases to be decided. Akira's dad was worried about her safety, so he decided to enroll her in a special class to learn how to protect herself. After a few days, Akira saw the same bad men who had escaped earlier. She wanted to stop them, so she tried to catch them. Once upon a time, there was a brave girl named Akira Sharma. One day, she saw some bad men hurting a lady by throwing a harmful liquid on her face. Akira was very brave and helped the police catch one of the bad men. But the criminal was angry at her and wanted revenge, so he hurt Akira by cutting her face, which left a mark.

Three years later, Akira is set free and becomes a tough and rebellious woman. When she starts going to college, her brother comes to pick up her and their mother. They move from Jodhpur to Mumbai. Akira joins a college and stays in a hostel, but she struggles to fit in with regular life. The college also has a problem with a student who keeps stealing electronics. One day, a police officer named ACP Rane, who is corrupt and drunk with power, hits an old professor with his car and then beats him up. This makes the college students very angry, so they organize a big protest. The protest becomes violent, but Akira waits patiently to give their request to the police chief.

A few days later, a person named Rane goes to help someone who got hurt in a car accident. But instead of helping, Rane takes the person's valuable things and hurts them even more. Rane's girlfriend, Maya, who goes to the same school as Akira, secretly records Rane talking about getting rid of the evidence. Unfortunately, Maya's bag with the camera inside gets stolen, and someone starts threatening Rane. Thinking that Maya did it, Rane hurts her very badly. But there is a police officer named SP Rabiya who thinks Maya's death is suspicious and investigates the case.

At the college, they say they will forgive the person who took the electronics if they give them back without anyone knowing. Akira finds a bag with all the stolen things, including the camera, in front of her room. Rane's friends catch her with the camera and want to hurt her and two other people who saw what happened. But luckily, she manages to get away when the bad guys have to put more bullets in their gun.

Rane and his friends say that Akira is not thinking clearly. They believe this because she has done violent things in the past and has been rebellious. They take her to a place for people who are not well in their minds. There, a doctor who is not honest helps them hurt Akira with electric shocks. But she has a friend who is also not well, and they work together to hurt the doctors and guards and get away. Akira takes one of Rane's friends and makes him do things to show that she did not do anything wrong. Rane finds where she is hiding and attacks her. Someone named Rabiya comes with papers that say Rane should be arrested, but they cannot do it because the person who was in a car crash was related to an important person in politics. Rane gets back his power and the person in charge says Akira must go back to the place for people who are not well in their minds. Rabiya leaves, but she takes the weapons they took from Rane's friends. This means the people inside do not have any weapons. Akira easily kills Rane and his friends without using weapons and goes back to the place for people who are not well in their minds. After three months, she is released because she is completely well. In the end, she moves to Jodhpur and lives a peaceful life teaching children who cannot hear like her father did.

With Bhau's enimity towards Gaitonde, Amartya meets Nari's key aide and gets information on Gaitonde's operations, where he attacks his men and is able to confiscate all his arsenal. Later, Amartya secures a bail for Nari and also threatens Gaitonde to get out of his way. Gaitonde realizes his diminishing strength and resents to his fate. Amartya gets uninhibited control of the city with Bhau's help.

Amartya sends Arjun to a boarding school to keep him away from his path of violence. Years later, Arjun is married to his childhood friend Seema, who arranges now grownup Arjun's marriage to his sweetheart Nilam and sends the newlywed couple to London again, intending to keep him away from Amartya's criminal life. Meanwhile, Gaitonde has now struck a deal with a mill owner Sunil Khaitan as he plans to oust the mill workers in order to utilize the mill land for a large reality project to take advantage of the newly liberalized economy. Wary of Gaitonde's rapid attempts to rise again, Amartya kills Khaitan after he refuses to heed his warnings.

Arjun returns to India and is attacked by Gaitonde's men as retribution to Khaitan's murder; on the other hand, Khaitan's wife Sonali announces a bounty of ₹10 crore to any policeman who kills Amartya. Inspector Vijay Savarkar leads an investigation into Amartya's case and gets hold of Sadashiv, a weakling of Amartya's gang. Sadashiv rats on his colleagues and Vijay is able to kill 4 of them. Arjun correctly suspects Sadashiv as the rat to verify this, Amartya asks Sadashiv to meet him at a park. He reaches there disguised as a taxi driver and spots policemen prepared for an ambush. Coincidentally, Vijay hires his taxi for his office and they greet each other as Vijay leaves his taxi.

Later, Arjun kills Sadashiv, who was under police protection, bribes the constables and shoots one of them in the arm to project it as an ambush. Bhau advises Amartya to leave the country since Khaitan's death, coupled with the ""ambush"" on the police, has put a lot of pressure on the police force to find him and it is not safe for him to stay in the city anymore. Amartya leaves for London and Arjun now runs the gang. Vijay gives a court order to Arjun and warns him against absentia, stating that he would get an encounter order from the court by default and would be free to kill him even in public place. Arjun is shot by Gaitonde's man when he appears in the court, but survives the attack and becomes permanently paralyzed. Amartya returns to India and rescues Arjun from the police, but is shot down by Vijay.","['Action', 'Crime']",The plot of the movie is set in the era of the 80s and 90s which were marked as a transformed period of Mumbai.,"Sadak 2,Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster Returns,Daddy,Malang - Unleash the Madness,Ek Villain Returns,An Action Hero"

2392447,Ungli,Crime Drama Thriller gang Angad Bedi friends man police people Commissi officer ano corrupt meets colleague,Crime Drama Thriller hands gang friends decide justice,"4 friends Kalim , Gautam , Maya  and Abhay  delve into what seems to be their ""first case"" , having started the Ungli gang, which fights against corruption. Their job is to bug corrupt people and teach them moral lessons quite unconventionally. They target a corrupt minister and become the most wanted people in Mumbai, but also earn respect, affection, and admiration in the media and general public.

Meanwhile, ACP Ashok Kaale  meets his superior, DCP Shivraman  who introduces him to Police Commissioner Arvind Kaul  with the task of deciphering the Ungli gang. Later, Kaale travels to another police station where he meets an amusingly frustrated officer, Kaale's colleague and bomb-squad commandant Shishir Mishra , who is disgusted with the ""crime"" his recruit Nikhil Abhyankar  has done. Eventually, it goes so: a college was attended to by the bomb squad when there was news that a bomb was planted there. Nikhil took advantage of the situation and met his girlfriend  with whom he shared a kiss, but soon they were caught by the dogs of the Bomb Squad. Later, it surfaced up that the call was made from Mishra's desk, and Nikhil did it. Kaale finds it funny at first and points out the clever act Nikhil made, but when the officer reprimands Nikhil and himself, Kaale visits Nikhil's mother  where she tells him that Nikhil had the qualities of his father, Kaale's colleague Arvind, and that Nikhil was raised by Kaale like his own son. Nikhil, it is shown, attends a disco bar, where Kaale calls him up to discuss matters concerning the ""Ungli"" gang.

Nikhil begins searching for altruistic opportunities to earn the Ungli gang great fame, once by blowing up the roads in front of a minister's house and accusing politicians and PWD workers of torturing the people by lavishly spending money on renovation of roads directly linked to houses and offices of politicians and corporates alone, another instance by putting up a label of dishonesty on the auto-rickshaw drivers by accusing them of charging high rates and showing reluctance when asked to drive to places close by. Finding him adamant, Maya suggests that Nikhil too has wishes to join the gang, and on certain terms and conditions, the four friends admit Nikhil, and narrate the story behind the gang's formation.

Maya's brother Rajeev Singh aka Ricky  was a great fitness freak and struck a rapport with the four friends quite a time. However, one day, while trying to prevent a scuffle between an old man  and a bratty youngster Anshuman, Ricky tried to defend the old man, but Anshuman struck him hard, landing him straight into coma. The old man later decided to complain to the police, but was advised against it by the police itself, when a hunchback of Police Supremo B.R. Dayal , Anshuman's father, spoke so. The old man was firm, but when his granddaughter, while waiting at a bus stop, was threatened with an acid attack, the old man was forced to swerve from his stand to protect her. This plunged Maya into grief, but Abhay was angry at one of Maya's comments and this paved the way for the ""Ungli"" gang. Nikhil poses as a law student to illusion the four.

While preparing for a raid, Nikhil sprained his knee, but later called up Kaale when the four left. However, feeling remorseful, he later attacked Kaale to defend his new ""friends"", but when his identity was discovered, the four friends slammed him with Abhay hitting him hard, and Kaale further hitting him, but Nikhil later chides Kaale for believing the ""Ungli"" gang as a criminal force. However, when faced with a loss of duty, finding that DCP Shivraman is trying to bribe him into getting a posting of choice to save ends, Kaale agrees with Nikhil, and seeks out the gang to expose Dayal. Meanwhile, Abhay confesses to his co-worker, Tiesta Sen  his love for her as well as his identity of the ""Ungli"" gang.

Exposing a dirty racquet of money makers in the widely distributed Mumbai police force with a simple chemical trick involving sulphur sprayed over printed notes that would leave a lasting black impressions on the officer's tongue via saliva, Kaale regains duty and is promoted to the post of Commissioner, getting Dayal and Anshuman arrested. Later, Kaale reassures the gang that the city won't need another as long as everything is under control.","['Crime', 'Drama', 'Thriller']",A gang of friends decide to take justice into their own hands.,"Double Dhamaal,Shaitan,Drishyam,Pagalpanti,Game,Singham"

13364468,Love Hostel,Action Crime Romance Thriller Ashu couple father sister mother younger police brother video film opens chilling scene newlywed celebrating union story task,Action Crime Romance Thriller Set rustic traces couple mercenary pulsating backdrop volatile journey spirited young hunted ruthless,"The film opens with the chilling scene of a newlywed couple celebrating their union on video. However, the joy is swiftly replaced by horror as an unknown assailant appears, and the couple is seen hanging by their necks, all captured on camera.

Dagar , the orchestrator of this brutal act, sends proof of the execution to those who might have hired him. Yet, a closer look at his visage hints at a personal vendetta behind the crime. It is revealed that the authorities believed Dagar to be deceased, sparking a debate over the accuracy of this assumption.

Moving forward, the story introduces us to the protagonists, Jyoti , a Hindu, and Ashu , a Muslim Jat. They plan to register their marriage with the help of a close friend, Sonu, acting as a witness. Their joyful mood is disrupted when Ashu receives a menacing call from an anonymous person, reminding him of an impending task.

The narrative then delves into the backgrounds of the protagonists' families and their respective challenges. Jyoti's family consists of her loving father, distant mother, vulnerable younger sister, and abusive younger brother. The other antagonist in the story is Jyoti's grandmother, a prominent political figure, determined to uphold tradition and societal reputation, and opposed to the couple's union due to religious differences. Meanwhile, viewers learn about Ashu's father, who was falsely implicated for possessing illegal firearms and wrongfully imprisoned. His mother appears to be suffering from a condition resembling schizophrenia.

The plot progresses as the couple successfully registers their marriage and escapes from Jyoti's potentially dangerous family. However, their refuge at a decrepit ""love hostel"" shared by numerous residents turns out to be far from ideal.

Troubles continue to mount as Ashu is pursued by the anonymous caller, forcing him to fulfill a dangerous task, leading to a perilous confrontation with both criminals and the police. It is then revealed that Ashu had been working as a police informant, helping in the apprehension of criminals, with the assistance of a dedicated police officer. After narrowly escaping this ordeal, the couple returns to the love hostel, only to face a new set of problems.

Dagar, the hitman, eventually tracks them down, but they manage to narrowly escape his clutches, seeking refuge in the unoccupied house of Sonu. Ashu, still determined, tries to rescue his mother, Jyoti's father, and her sister. Tragically, he discovers his mother's lifeless body, strangled by Dagar. In an attempt to rescue Jyoti's mistreated sister, he succeeds initially, with the help of Jyoti's father, but their victory is short-lived. Jyoti's younger brother shoots Ashu and abducts his sister, taking her back to their home.

On Jyoti's side, Dagar finally catches up with her, tying her up and preparing to end her life. The homeowner returns, revealing that Sonu is Dagar's daughter. The motive behind Dagar's intense hatred is unveiled—an incident where his brother had committed suicide due to a betrayal by his own daughter, who was assisted by Sonu.

There is a brief glimmer of hope when Jyoti breaks free of her restraints. Unfortunately, that hope is extinguished when Dagar shoots her. Now victorious, Dagar continues his journey. He makes a pit stop to change his tires, during which he interacts with a dog he had brought along, a wounded companion from a prior visit to the veterinary hospital. Dagar presumably visits a veterinarian whom he has bribed to keep his identity hidden. The dog playfully crosses the road, and Dagar, displaying a glimpse of humanity, follows. However, this fleeting moment of compassion is short-lived as Dagar is struck by an oncoming truck and lies sprawled on the roadside.","['Action', 'Crime', 'Romance', 'Thriller']","Set against the pulsating backdrop of rustic North India, Love Hostel traces the volatile journey of a spirited young couple, being hunted by a ruthless mercenary.","Raat Akeli Hai,Hate Story 2,Missing,Operation Romeo,Goodbye,Ragini MMS"

He looks after his father Gurnam's dairy, but due to his raw mannerisms, he is unable to impress any girl proposed to his family for an arranged marriage. His friend Sukhi, a filmy buff, suggests that he should create a bad boy image to woe girls as shown in latest flicks. Both go on a bad boy drive, breaking many rules and giving rise to varying comical instances. Unknown to them, this is all recorded by a private detective Madhu Mangal Rane , who is known to perform background checks on prospective grooms.

When Suraj and his family meet the next prospective bride, her family shows them the photographs of his bad-boy drive and rejects his proposal. Gurnam  feels disgraced and leaves the house. Suraj then catches hold of Pandit Dubey , who had earlier proposed this relation, and learns of Mangal's involvement. He decides to avenge the humiliation of his family and goes after Mangal.

Mangal belongs to a middle-class family and lives with his younger sister Tulshi  and his mother Rekha  in a chawl. Tulshi is considered the epitome of traditional girls with good moral values as per contemporary standards by one and all. Suraj and Sukhi first do a recce of Mangal's office in disguise, and then, late in the night, raid his office. Tulshi, who has just returned from her late-night tuitions, sees intruders in his office and enters to check out what is happening. Sukhi immediately runs away, but Suraj's coat gets stuck in the door. Their eyes meet for the first time and Suraj is immediately struck by her beauty. When her family and neighbours gather at the office, Mangal correctly suspects that Suraj has been here when he sees his photo and file missing from the office.

To avenge this nightly raid, Mangal mixes water in Suraj's milk cans the next day. Later, Suraj gets hold of a family photo featuring Mangal which they had earlier stolen from his office and learns that Tulshi is Mangal's sister. He chases her and they meet at a cosmetics store and they have a casual chat. Suraj had damaged her moped earlier, and he tells her that he would get it repaired. On this pretext, he drops her home and obtains her phone number. The next day he takes her on a date on the pretext of handing over her moped back. Tulshi also starts warming up to his romantic advances. Mangal meanwhile has found two suitors for her and most likely she would marry one of them. Tulshi reluctantly agrees with her brother as most traditional girls are expected to marry a suitor usually selected by someone elder in her family.

As their relation becomes stronger, Tulshi decides to reveal her profession to Suraj. She leads him and Sukhi to tuition class where she is supposed to teach, but exits from another door to a discotheque. Later they see her on stage in a fully modern avatar, completely contrary to her traditional personality, as a DJ. Suraj and Sukhi both enjoy her music, and Sukhi sees an opportunity for Suraj to get even with Mangal.

The next day the first suitor calls Mangal to reject his proposal after seeing Tulshi's DJ avatar in the newspaper. Mangal is thoroughly shocked and cannot come to terms that he was completely unaware of his sister's profession which is considered unacceptable in contemporary society and prohibits Tulshi from pursuing her DJ activity. She is deeply hurt by this and seeks solace with Suraj, whose confession pushes her into further grief. Suraj, with persistent efforts, is able to win back her trust. On the other side, Mangal comes to terms with his defeat and plans another act to get revenge. He meets Suraj's parents and proposes Tulshi's marriage with Suraj which everyone agrees to, despite Tulshi and Suraj doubting this sudden change of heart.

On the day of their engagement, Mangal tricks Gurnam into talking about dowry, which he records, and has the Dhillons arrested for dowry. Tulshi is heartbroken yet again as she cannot approve Suraj asking for dowry and resigns her fate to Mangal, who arranges her meeting with the second suitor he had spoken earlier and their marriage is fixed in haste.

After seeking bail, Suraj discovers that Mangal is in a romantic relation with a woman, Kavya , who is married to a OCD-esque maths professor Chinmay Godbole . Seeking revenge, Suraj produces evidence of adultery to Chinmay and asks him to press charges of adultery on Mangal, which he refuses because he hates the courts where nothing is in order. Suraj realises Kavya's plight and then tortures Chinmay by putting everything in sight out of order, forcing him to sign the divorce papers.

On the day of Tulshi's marriage, Kavya rushes to Mangal and tells him that Suraj made her husband sign the divorce papers. Mangal, who was unsure of the match from the beginning, realises his mistake and apologies to Tulshi and Rekha, and they flee from the marriage. They go to the railway station where Suraj is returning with his parents to their native place forever to escape from the humiliation of their dowry charges. Out of desperation, Mangal pulls the emergency chain to stop it and searches for Suraj. He is able to finally reunite Tulshi and Suraj, but the TTE charges him for stopping the train. As Mangal has forgotten to carry his wallet, he is unable to pay the fine; when the Dhillons refuse as well, Mangal is sent to jail.",['Comedy'],"In the 1990s, a wedding detective has to perform background checks on prospective grooms.

He meets two criminals, Pandit and Idris and they offer him a chance to assist a bank robbery. If the heist is successful, they will ensure that he never has to worry about money again, so he accepts the offer.

The three thieves make off with 30 crore inr.

After the bank robbery, Pandit decides that Sanju should keep the suitcase of money hidden  and that they will meet after three months and then they will split the money.

After three months, Pandit and Idris discover that Sanjay lost his memory in an accident with head injury and hence, Sanju is suffering with retrograde amnesia.

Pandit and Idris decide that they can not trust Sanju anymore, they need to keep a close eye on him in case he runs away. They stay at Sanjay and Neetu's house until Sanjay remembers where he hid the money and to make sure they're not cheated. They give him a week to do so.

Sanjay tries to remember where he hid the money but he can not.

When Sanjay learns that his college friend Uttam Nagpal  has become an overnight millionaire, apparently by winning a lottery, he suspects Uttam.

Then, he suspects his wife Neetu of knowing the hiding place of the money because she has joint account with him and also sole-access to their bank-locker. He accuses her of conspiring with his friend.

Later, Sanju finds out that Uttam moves to London after being confronted about the money and also Sanjay finds out that Neetu has purchased a one-way ticket for London so he goes to buy a gun to kill his wife Neetu in anger.

While he is doing this, an unknown person contacts Sanjay and urges him to divulge the location of the money.

Under pressure and now frustrated, Pandit and Idris kidnap Neetu and ask Sanjay to meet them in a train station by writing a note and attaching it on the screen of his TV, on the third platform at 1:30am.

When both Pandit and Idris confront Sanjay and demand the money, Sanjay claims that he doesn't even recognize the two.

When Sanjay tells them that Neetu knew where the money was, Idris begins to lose control. When he pulls the trigger on his pistol, he is shot dead by the unknown person and thereafter, he kills Pandit in a rage in the train.

The unknown person tells Sanjay that the bank robbery plan idea was his which he shared with Idris and Pandit but never got his share ...and after persistently questioning and trying to blackmail Sanjay, the unknown person shoots frantically in frustration and Neetu is injured—hoping that the traumatic vision of his wife's suffering will make Sanjay reveal the truth.

However, this fails since Sanjay has in fact lost all his memory by now stressed by trauma.

The original mastermind of the bank heist searches Sanjay's pockets, only to find a banana. In retaliation, he shoots Sanjay in the shoulder and then Sanjay's phone rings.

It is revealed that the caller is Sanju's mother who calls his son like every other day out of her motherly affection and concern however during the conversation she sub-consciously reveals that the suitcase has been kept at her home while remaining implicitly oblivious as to what is in the suitcase and further questions Sanju whether he will be coming to take the suitcase or not. She further expresses her desire to sell the brief case off if in case Sanju does not turn up to take away his belonging. Meanwhile, the heist's mastermind overhears this and jumps on the train out of excitement but he slips on Sanjay's banana skin and impales his neck on Sanjay's fork. Disillusioned, confused and tired, Sanjay throws his phone out of the train while Neetu smiles. Sanjay has no idea what's going on, but the train goes on its way with the dead bodies of the mastermind, Pandit and Idris.[","['Comedy', 'Crime', 'Thriller']",A safe cracker claims he has lost his memory when two criminals come calling for their cut of the bank heist loot.,"Pagalpanti,No Problem,Saaho,Batla House,Drishyam,Players"

They have a big argument and Ayan decides to walk away. He goes to Saba, who gives him a big hug and tells him that she has started to really love him. But she is worried that if their love gets stronger, she will end up getting hurt because she knows Ayan will never love her as much as he loved Alizeh. So, they decide to break up and Ayan leaves.

14339846,Mrs Undercover,Action Comedy Thriller person man husband common dates college undercover refuses special force convinces,Action Comedy Thriller housewife undercover simple terrifying psycho fact special agent called back job killer maintaining parallel life,"An unidentified man who calls himself ""The Common Man"" dates a beautiful girl. However, on the pretext of dropping her home, he takes her to a secluded place and brutally kills her. Before killing her he makes a video from her phone where she is narrating how she got a conviction for her client's husband as a lawyer, which he broadcasts to news channel.

A team of special force lead by Rangeela is tracking Common Man, a serial killer who targets strong and independent professional women. The common man has a white-collared job by the day and lives with his mother. He has a team that keeps an eye on the special force and kills one of their last agents. With great difficulty, Rangeela locates an undercover agent Durga who is a housewife and at times clumsy in her work, lives with her husband, in-laws and has a school-going kid.

Rangeela convinces her to go undercover and reveal the identity of the common man. Durga flatly refuses as it has been 13 years and her cover has now become the reality of her life. With perseverance, Rangeela convinces Durga for the job. She requests a refresher training, but Rangeela refuses because this would expose her to the moles of the common man.

Her first task is to chase a person who would exchange a packet at Victoria Memorial at 8:30 pm. Durga is quick witted and balances her household duties along with her undercover work and tracks a person going inside a girl's college.

Meanwhile Durga meets a woman named Ayesha who has rented a house next door. Next Durga is assigned a course in the same college. Her husband mocks her and flatly refuses to allow her to take the course. This conversation is overheard by her mother-in-law. She explains to her son how a good husband should not try to control his wife, but support her endeavours.

On the first day of college, Durga bumps into Ayesha who is a teacher there. Later in her first class unknown to her, she comes face-to-face with the common man who is their instructor Ajay Sir.

By the night Durga hones her skills with her son's toy guns and video games and in the day time tries to trace who the common man is. Ajay meanwhile has written to the CM of the state who is a woman to attend an art performance in his college. Rangeela requests CM to accept the invitation as this gives them a chance to reveal common man. Accidentally Durga reads romantic chats of Ayesha with her husband's and goes in a state of shock and stops reporting to her duty. Rangeela visits her place and convinces her to report back to her duty in return she would get feeds of her husband's chat.

Ayesha is revealed to be a mole of Ajay who wants to tie all loose ends before he executes the biggest job i.e. kill the CM. Ayesha mistakes Durga's husband to be an undercover agent and calls him to a hotel to eliminate him.

Durga who has also received the message, saves her husband in nick of time. Her husband is shocked by her new avatar however he will have to stay in custody so that her cover is not blown. Late night Ayesha attempts to kill Durga but gets eliminated by Durga herself.

Next day at the performance in the college in presence of CM, Durga spots Ajay leaving the hall and figures out he is the common man and the target is CM who would be eliminated by a bomb to be exploded as confetti is blown at the end of the performance. Durga is able to diffuse the bomb, evacuate the hall and corner Ajay and expose his identity as the common man.

When he finds that there is no escape he confronts her and tell that special force does not have any credible evidence that would hold in the court and he would be free within few hours. Durga concedes that they do not have any credible evidence and hence the only way justice can be meted out would be killing him and making a video in the same manner he did for his victims. The CM agrees to this and next day it is revealed in the news that Common man is dead.

Durga's husband apologizes for cheating on her, however, she refuses to accept his apology as there is no sincerity in it. The film ends with Rangeela assigning her a new mission with a new cover.","['Action', 'Comedy', 'Thriller']","A simple Indian housewife who is in fact a special undercover agent is called back on the job after 10 years of being undercover to take down a terrifying, psycho killer while maintaining her parallel life of a housewife.","Code Name: Tiranga,Cuttputlli,Durgamati: The Myth,Kahaani,Kahaani 2,Operation Mayfair"
10733228,Gehraiyaan,Drama Romance bec Deepik kes suffoc film life ble end Siddh tion pped ted ting swe,Drama Romance relationships journey deep rooted intricacies modern human,"Alisha , a yoga instructor, believes that her personal and professional lives are in shambles. She's having trouble finding an investor for her fitness software, and her six-year relationship with Karan, a struggling writer, has reached a stalemate.
Just when she thinks she's had enough of her boring life, her filthy rich cousin  and her hot-shot fiancee Zain show up . Within a short period of time, Alisha and Zain become oddly attracted to each other and embark on a passionate love affair, keeping their respective partners in the dark. During their romantic encounters and passionate love-making sessions, the two bond over their traumatic past, blissfully unaware of the impending storm.
An early moment in Gehraiyaan, which lasts only a few seconds, embodies the film's entire core. Alisha , the film's protagonist, is viewing an old home movie. It's a scenario from a family vacation, and she recognizes something: her pre-teen self trying to put on a sweater, which gets trapped around her neck and covers her head. Alisha can't see or breathe, and she says she's ""suffocating"" to her mother. That sense of being trapped and suffocated, which dates back to her youth, has followed her throughout her life.
Her mother used to describe the same sensation; when the anguish grew overwhelming, she hung herself from the ceiling fan . Alisha, like many other children of unhappy parents, fears that she, too, would become like them, that she, too, will be unable to escape their past. It's even more difficult for her because she is constantly reminded of her history. She had known Karan  and Tia while growing up in Mumbai for a few years . For the past six years, Karan, a former ad writer currently working on a book , has been dating and living with Alisha. He is oblivious and inattentive because he is engrossed in his own world. Alisha, a yoga instructor, has been having trouble raising money for her mobile app. She avoids her father since she holds him responsible for her mother's death. She feels ""suffocated"" since the sweater has adhered to her again.
However, she rekindles her friendship with Tia, and the childhood trio takes a break. There's a new member this time: her fiancee, Zain . After some time, Alisha realizes that Zain, who has his own scars from the past, isn't all that different from her. He, like Alisha, was unable to save his mother. He isn't from a well-adjusted family, unlike Tia and Karan, and he isn't 'normal.' Zain is a warm blazing bulb in a sea of flickering and chilly tube lights: someone who has been there, someone who understands. They converse, drink, and tell stories. They flirt, joke, and hook up. The sweater is finally loosening up. Alisha can finally take a breath.
This wonderful mix of awareness and perplexity makes perfect sense, because it highlights the film's most striking layer: Alisha is living a lie because she is intent on finding and moulding her story. The climax was surprising because we saw Zain, who Alisha had come to see as her anchor, change into someone who wanted to kill her because she had become an obstacle in his life. When Alisha discovers Zain's texts and notices him slipping tablets to her drink, she understands he's been lying to her yet again. In the ensuing brawl, Zain takes a knock to the head and falls off the yacht, killing himself. That's when Alisha returns to the mainland on her own.
""Gehraiyaan"" gets it right when it comes to how trauma may be passed down through generations and how, without correct guidance, we end up repeating the mistakes we are trying to avoid. Alisha began the affair to get out of a dead-end relationship in which she was trapped because she didn't want to be like her mother. However, when the truth was revealed, she realized she had made the same errors. She decides to accept her past and move on from it rather than resisting it in a very vulnerable chat with her father. This reminds us of something we've heard before: you can't get rid of your luggage; you can only learn to carry it in such a way that it doesn't seem as heavy over time.
Another part of the conclusion is if Zain was aware of Alisha and Tia's reality and if this knowledge influenced any of his actions. We can only assume that even if he was aware, he did nothing about it because the entire property was obviously in Tia's name. The real kicker, though, comes in the final few seconds of the film. As Alisha makes the decision to put the past behind her, a phantom of it appears in front of her. The old woman who confronted Alisha in the end was someone Alisha and Zain had aided during one of their rendezvous on the yacht while they were still together.
At the engagement party, Alisha runs into the old woman, who recognizes her and addresses her by her name. ""Gehraiyaan"" comes to an end here, and it's up to the audience to figure out what transpired. Is Alisha manage to redirect the topic and resolve it in time, or does the old woman explain to Tia how she knows Alisha and Zain? Is everything Alisha tries to put behind her about to resurface and cling to her even more tightly than before? Is it a hint that you'll never completely be able to let go of your past-messy relics will always find their way back into your life? That's the one part where we welcome the viewer's imagination being used.","['Drama', 'Romance']",Takes you on a journey into the deep rooted intricacies of modern human relationships.,"Jahaan Chaar Yaar,Ankahi Kahaniya,I, Me Aur Main,Ae Dil Hai Mushkil,Kaalakaandi,Goodbye"

They settle in after a while and Sushant and Aparna make love. The man in the room below is shown to be creeping about and peeping into rooms.

They talk and bond and Sushant invites Aparna to spend the next couple days with him. That is how they came to the resort. When Titli suddenly goes missing Aparna throws a fit.

They try their best to find Titli but their efforts to contain the situation are foiled when Aparna calls the police.

It is revealed that she is a dangerous mental patient who managed to escape from an asylum.

Arjan Sethi , an aspiring filmmaker with a vision to create a film on psychopaths, faces multiple rejections from film producers and family pressure. To make ends meet, he joins the Himachal Pradesh Police, thanks to his brother-in-law Narinder Singh , a police officer.

Arjan's new career as a Sub-Inspector places him in a challenging situation, as he lacks experience in police work. He moves in with his sister Seema , Narinder, and their daughter Payal. Trouble brews when Payal faces issues in school, prompting Arjan to meet her teacher Divya  and pose as Payal's father, although his true identity is soon uncovered. Arjan also befriends Divya's hearing and speech-impaired niece, Iti.

Amidst these personal challenges, Arjan finds himself investigating the abduction of a schoolgirl named Amrita. He uncovers disturbing similarities between Amrita's case and Samiksha's murder, primarily due to the mutilations on a doll found at Amrita's residence. However, his attempts to convince his superior officer, SHO Gudiya Parmar , are in vain. Tragically, Amrita's mutilated body is discovered a few days later, further affirming the connection between the two cases.

In the following days, another hearing-impaired girl named Komal from Divya's school is abducted and killed. The trail leads to Purushottam Tomar, a teacher at Payal's new school, who preys on young girls. During a confrontation with Arjan, Tomar admits to his predatory behavior but denies involvement in the murders. He takes SHO Parmar hostage, but Arjan intervenes, leading to Tomar's death.

The same day, Payal is abducted from her birthday party at home. Her lifeless body is found in the car trunk two days later. Arjan's negligence in using his firearm when arresting Tomar results in his suspension. Determined to uncover the truth, Arjan embarks on an unofficial investigation with the help of a few policemen, including Head Constable Mahinder Guleria.

Arjan discovers an audio clip from Komal's hearing aid, tracing it to a piano tune played by Agnes, a lady magician/pianist who performed at all the victims' schools. He informs SHO Parmar, who reinstates him on the case. Arjan deduces that Agnes randomly selects her victims from the audience, subsequently killing them within days. Her next target is a girl named Aisha. Despite surveillance, Aisha is abducted, but Arjan and his team locate her in time to prevent her murder.

Arjan tracks Agnes to an abandoned building and learns that Agnes is, in fact, a man named Christopher. Christopher, who suffers from progeria, reveals that he was bullied as a child and was befriended by a girl named Sofia. However, when he confessed his love to Sofia, she humiliated him. Agnes, his mother, helped him kill Sofia. After her death, Christopher continued to murder girls who reminded him of Sofia while masquerading as Agnes.

A tense showdown between Arjan and Christopher ensues, but with Iti's help, Arjan overpowers Christopher. Divya joins the confrontation, and they walk away from Christopher's lifeless body, the mystery finally unraveled.","['Crime', 'Drama', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']","When a small town gets plunged into the nightmare of serial killings, rookie cop Arjan embarks on a chase for the truth and unravels a gruesome conspiracy.","Raman Raghav 2.0,Gumraah,Thar,Raat Akeli Hai,Samrat &amp; Co.,Dial 100"

There is no explanation given as to why she would need these hazardous items inside the office premises. She would be using these things for her own benefit further along in the plot, and that’s why this element had to be added somehow. She also mentions that she will be travelling to Delhi later that night with her fiancé. This seems like a ploy presented in an obvious fashion by the makers to let the audience know this is an important part of the plot, and has a significance in the narrative ahead. 

Rakesh, on the other hand, gets a confirmation message regarding his flight to Delhi. This proves that the man is up to something by mirroring Satya’s actions. He informs her of the same, which proves he probably does not want to come across as a stalker, and since they are friends, it makes sense for him to share his flight details as well. He works on the tech team, it is assumed, but it is not clear why he is working from a room that has CCTV of the entire office in front of him. Is he on the security team, or has it been placed in his office for his benefit?

The fiancé, Vishal, asks Rakesh for help regarding their travel plans that night. This suggests that Rakesh is good friends with Vishal as well but not as close as he is with Satya. He comes across as the problem solver who would do anything for Vishal and Satya. Vishal is unable to look through Rakesh’s eyes and see why he is willing to do the work, which has nothing to do with the actual office work. In passing, Vishal mentions that after him, it would only be Rakesh who would keep Satya happy. This would mean that Rakesh knows Satya as well as he does, but only as a friend. This brings a sparkle to Rakesh’s eyes, and it is obvious from here on that the man is planning an elaborate setup that would involve Satya and Vishal not catching the flight out of Mumbai. It is mostly a stalker situation because it is predictable this is the ruse.","['Drama', 'Romance', 'Thriller']","Sathya is a highly successful corporate executive who look forward to a bright future with her fiance,Vishal.One night ,when she is about to board a fight to Delhi, Satya finds herself trapped within the office .What danger awaits her?","Shaadi Mein Zaroor Aana,Satyaprem Ki Katha,Murder 3,Tadka,Shikara,Hate Story IV"

Despite their daily hardships, Sarita and Sushant share a musical background, and we learn through a flashback that Sarita froze on stage during a reality singing show when she saw the large audience. This traumatic experience continues to haunt her, causing stress and anxiety.

In the present, Sarita works as a bank teller and is the sole breadwinner of the family, while Sushant frequently faces unemployment and engages in small schemes to make money. The burden of long working hours and the responsibility of managing the household lead to frequent fights and issues between Sarita and Sushant.

Meanwhile, in their apartment building, an unknown man brings a heavy suitcase and hides large cash bundles in a ziploc bag, stuffing it into the bathroom drain. This hidden location causes the water sewage pipe to choke frequently, resulting in unusual noises in the Pillais' kitchen sink. Sarita, waking up one night to get water, discovers the hidden cash in the choked pipe. She is astonished and, after verifying the cash's validity at her bank, uses it to pay off Sushant's debts and indulge in buying high-end items for their home. To explain the sudden influx of cash, she tells Sushant that it came from her mother's fixed deposit.

As Sarita continues to benefit from the hidden cash, their neighbors' struggles and the strained relationship between Sarita and her neighbor downstairs, whom she affectionately calls Tai , are also depicted. Sarita shares a friendly yet stressful bond with Tai, and they both rely on the hidden cash to alleviate their financial difficulties.

However, their newfound prosperity comes to an abrupt end when Prime Minister Modi introduces demonetization, banning the use of Rs. 500 and 1000 notes. Sarita and Tai are devastated by the news. Tai, who was preparing for her daughter's wedding, is left in a difficult situation, while Sarita finds herself back in the struggle-filled life she had hoped to escape.

As demonetization takes its toll, Sarita faces angry customers, long hours, and increased stress at the bank. On the other hand, Sushant becomes suspicious of Sarita's behavior, believing she is having an extramarital affair after seeing a video involving Reddy, a man from whom Sushant had borrowed money. Unbeknownst to Sushant, Sarita had used the hidden cash to repay Reddy.

Sarita continues to find solace in the hidden cash when she discovers new currency notes of Rs. 2000 denomination in her kitchen pipe. Excited by this unexpected windfall, she takes extreme measures to hide her secret, even locking up the kitchen and preventing unwanted guests from entering.

Unfortunately, Sarita's cash gathering comes to a halt when thieves hold the bank employees at gunpoint and steal all the money, including the cash she had kept in her purse. Devastated by this loss, she returns home with a heavy heart, feeling that she has once again failed at a crucial moment in her life.

Despite Sushant's reassurances, Sarita decides to hide the truth about the stolen money from him. Little does she know that the police are conducting a criminal investigation into the large sums of Rs. 2000 notes, which were obtained by a local politician through a corrupt bank officer in another city. When questioned by the police, Sarita is taken aback, fearing that her use of the hidden cash will lead to unnecessary trouble for her. However, Sushant intervenes and reveals the existence of the ziploc bags filled with cash. The police then discover that the large bags were brought into the building by an assistant of the local politician, containing newly minted money. Sarita and Sushant's neighbors seize this opportunity and discreetly take large sums of cash for themselves, returning to their homes undetected. The police obtain Sushant's details during their investigation.

One year later, after returning from a trip, the Pillais receive the news that they are entitled to collect 10% of the recovered cash from the police.

But then, Kumar's mom and dad who were separated, make up and realize that they both think Kumar has a different wife. They also find out that Kumar is going to marry Deepika.

Karan and Deepika had to wait for a long time at a special building where people go for important things. When Kumar finally arrived, he saw his three wives who had become good friends with Deepika. But Kumar had to hide because he wasn't supposed to have more than one wife. Karan then told Deepika and the wives that the person they were supposed to marry had gone to the hospital to help a friend, and they should wait two more days for the wedding.

Everybody starts crying and Kumar's mom gives him a big hug. Deepika's dad asks Deepika to make a decision. In the end, all four wives accept each other, but Tiger is still confused.

A blinded Prithviraj is able to kill all of them but faints due to weakness.The story then shifts back a few years before in Kannauj where princess Sanyogita , Jayachand's  daughter is in love with Prithviraj Chauhan who is ruling Ajmer. In Ajmer, Prithviraj is approached by Mir Hossain who is the brother of Ghori. Ghori and Hossain were brothers, but a rift occurred between them because Hossain ran with Chitralekha, a dancer in Ghori's kingdom, as both loved each other. Prithvi is also angered that Ghori destroyed a Shiv temple and put the Shivling outside the steps of a mosque, so everyone could wipe their feet on it.
Prithviraj ensures Hossain that he will help him and takes him in his kingdom. This act angers Ghori and he decides to attack Ajmer if Prithviraj does not send Hossain back to him. Ghori sends Qutb Al-Din Aibak to Ajmer. Prithviraj rejects Ghori's demand. As Aibak warns him, Prithviraj accepts the demand for a war. This results in the First Battle of Tarain where Prithviraj along with Kaka Kanha , Chand Bardai  and his men are able to defeat Ghori 's army, but Mir Hossain is killed in the battle. Meanwhile, Ghori is captured by Prithviraj, but after few days he is released. Ghori wanted death, but Prithvi spares him on the challenge that GHori would make him regret if Prithvi doesn't kill him then and there. It was Prithvi's ego that made him release Ghori.Prithviraj Chauhan is selected as ruler of Delhi. Delhi was ruled by a maternal grandfather of Prithvi and Jayachand. He selects Prithvi as he is better than Jayachand in all aspects. This angers Jayachand who himself wanted to rule Delhi. He warns that the consequences of this act will not be good. Jayachand decides to organize a Svayamvara for Sanyogita and Rajasuya Yagya to increase his empire. He also sends an invitation to Prithviraj for the Rajasuya Yagya, asking 50 per cent control on Delhi taxes, which Prithviraj rejects.

The India cricket board slaps a life-ban on him. Azhar decides to challenge the ban in court with the help of his lawyer friend Reddy .The story shifts to 1963, when Azhar was born to a middle-class family in Hyderabad. His grandfather  dreamed of Azhar playing 100 tests for Team India, and motivates a soft-spoken Azhar to answer his rivals with his batting skills. Young Azhar goes for an Indian team selection match to Mumbai, where on match day he receives news of his grandfather's death. Nonetheless, he participates in the match, in accordance with his grandfather's last wish. Azhar impresses the selectors, sealing his place in Team India, and he soon becomes national hero by scoring 3 consecutive centuries in his first 3 test innings. Azhar soon marries Naureen  and they both begin a happy married life.After a loss against Pakistan in 1991, the president of cricket broad calls Azhar for a one-on-one meeting. Azhar initially fears getting dropped from the team, but is surprised when he is offered the position of team captain. Some senior players,like Manoj, Ravi and Navjot, resent Azhar's appointment, not wishing to take orders from a younger player. But Kapil  supports and encourages him to focus on his duty.While playing in an India-Pakistan match, Javed taunts Azhar, telling Azhar his Muslim heritage would be a better fit for the Pakistan team. Azhar leads his team to victory, and soon becomes a successful captain.
At peak of his career, Azhar's personal life takes a twist when he meets a former Miss India, Bollywood actress Sangeeta  during an ad film shoot and falls in love with her. They both begin dating but kept their relationship hidden, until it is exposed by a gossip magazine. Azhar then publicly announces his affair with Sangeeta. Heartbroken, Naureen asks him for a divorce, and soon Azhar leaves her to marry Sangeeta.During a cricket match against the West Indies, Azhar gets in a spat with Manoj for a slow run rate in order to complete his century, letting the team lose. Manoj is dropped from the next match and Azhar leads the team to victory. Manoj is humiliated and vows to take revenge. In later years of his career, Azhar famous for his expensive lifestyle, comes into the eyes of match-fixers. He is soon been approached by a London-based bookie disguised as a diamond merchant, who later offers him 1 Crore rupees to under play in a match against Sri Lanka, which Azhar hesitantly accepts.In a parallel story, after the match-fixing scandal, Azhar is now facing nationwide criticism and a London-based prosecutor, Meera , is building up a strong case against him on the basis of sting operations done by Manoj on Ravi, Navjot and several other cricketers. She also uses the report of the inquiry commission set up by the cricket board and secretly meets bookie M. K. Sherma to gather more evidence.Meera also approaches Naureen, asking her to serve as a witness, but she refuses. Meanwhile, Azhar and his lawyer Reddy are struggling to find any proof of innocence as none of his fellow cricketers are ready to help him out. Azhar attends a gym-opening ceremony to gain back his old fame in public, but is left insulted by the owner himself.
After a long, eight-year legal fight, Reddy finally makes a breakthrough by proving in court that the inquiry commission report is biased, as they were paid by cricket board itself. Reddy even challenges the authenticity of sting operation tapes as none of the witness was under oath and can not be treated as truth. Later, Azhar also reveals that he took 1 Crore rupees from the bookie to keep him away from other team members but later scored a match winning innings and returned all the money.On the final day of judgment both Naureen and Sangeeta attend the court hearing, showing their support for Azhar. Kapil also states in a television interview that he believes Azhar is innocent. In its final verdict, the court declares Azhar innocent and free from all match-fixing allegations due to lack of evidence. Azhar once again proudly walks out of the court with his head high and name cleared from all scandals.","['Biography', 'Drama', 'Sport']","Biographical sports drama based on the life of former Indian international cricketer, Mohammad Azharuddin","M.S.

One day her daughter Sanaya  is kidnapped and no ransom is demanded, but instead the kidnapper contacts her and tells her that she has to defend a convicted felon to get her daughter back. The felon is Miyaaz Shaikh  who is convicted for rape and murder of a young woman and the case against him is set for judgment in four days.
The kidnapper keeps track of Anuradha very closely to make sure she complies with his demand. With the pressure of time against her, Anuradha tries to get help from her suspended police friend Yohan  who has been suspended from the police force for flaunting the rules and regulations too often.The case against Miyaaz Shaikh is handled by a renowned public prosecutor Ronit  who has been defeated by Anuradha and hence has a long time professional rivalry against her. Anuradha races against time and saves her daughter by twisting the laws to win the case.
Miyaaz Shaikh is a serial rapist and murderer and has done jail time before. He has been arrested for the rape and murder of Sia . Yohan was the inspector who arrested Miyaaz. Yohan has been begging Anu to take his suspension case, which Anu is refusing, but agrees to cooperate with her in the Miyaaz case. Yohan and Anu meet the doctor who conducted the autopsy and then meet Garima , Sia's mother. Garima doesn't know Anu is Miyaaz's new lawyer & speaks to her. She wants Miyaaz to hang, but Miyaaz's death means Sanaya's death to Anu.
Home Minister Mahesh Malkai  is involved and asks Ronit to ensure that Miyaaz should hang. Yohan is convinced that Miyaaz is guilty, but Anu is not so sure as the killer removed all traces of DNA from Sia's body by washing it with alcohol. Yet Miyaaz fingerprints were all over the murder and rape scene.Anu checks's Sia's computer and finds her photos of Sam . Sam is now in a mental facility, having fried his brain with the reckless use of drugs. He was admitted one week before Sia was murdered.
As the trial starts, Garima realizes that Anu is Miyaaz's lawyer. Anu tries to establish that Sia was a party person, having sex with many men & that no one forced his way into her house on the night of her murder. So, she was raped and murdered by one of her known friends & not by Miyaaz, who was in Sia's house to steal some money for her ill mother.
Ronit produces Miyaaz's wife in court who claims that Miyaaz supplied drugs to Sia and had gone out to recover money from her on the night of her murder. Miyaaz admits to Anu in private that he raped and murdered Sia. Anu doesn't tell this to anyone and still has Yohan looking for clues to acquit Miyaaz. Yohan finds that Sam was not in hospital a week before Sia's murder and had in fact attended her funeral.Yohan finds that Mahesh Maklai is Sam's father. Mahesh tells Anu that Sam did bring Sia's body to his house on the night of her murder, but he was completely under the influence of drugs and had no re-collection of the events prior to that. So Mahesh got the body washed with alcohol and disposed under a bridge. Mahesh then destroys all evidence linking Sam to Sia's murder.
In court, Anu argues that Sam and Miyaaz were at Sia's apartment at the time of her murder. She contends that either of them could have killed Sia and there was no concrete proof that linked either of them positively to the murder itself. To prove her theory, she produces Sam in court . Sam agrees that he was in the apartment on the night & when he woke up, he found her dead. He took her body to his house, where his father doused Sia with alcohol and abandoned her body. This creates enough uncertainty to ensure that the court is unable to convict Miyaaz and releases him on bail till a murder weapon is found with the killer's fingerprints on it.As soon as Miyaaz is released, he is ambushed and abducted by an assassin named Vijay. Yohan traces Vijay, who tells him that Garima is the brains behind the operation. Sanaya is released and found alive. Anu confronts Garima, who admits that she burnt Miyaaz alive to get revenge for Sia. She promises Anu that she kept Sanaya as her own daughter. Police arrests Garima and Anu decides to represent her in court.","['Action', 'Crime', 'Drama', 'Thriller']","Tensions arise when the daughter of nation's best lawyer is kidnapped.

So, they get married and Kabir becomes a house husband, even though his dad didn't like it. Kabir takes care of the house while Kia goes to work and earns money for the family.

The person interviewing her is impressed and wants to meet Kabir. During the meeting, Kabir explains that it doesn't matter if a girl does things that boys usually do, and if a boy does things that girls usually do.

Kabir did a really good job in the interview and lots of people liked it. They asked him to do more talks and speeches about treating boys and girls the same and how marriages are different now. But because Kabir had so many things to do, it made it hard for him and Kia to spend time together. Kia started feeling jealous because Kabir was getting famous and she thought he was only doing it to get attention. She asked him to stop doing these public events.

While Kia is in a different country for work, Kabir goes to a party with people from his old school. One of his friends convinces him to do an interview that gets shown on TV.

At the same time, Kia's mom gets sick and has to go to the hospital, so Kia has to hurry back to India.

When they got home, Kia tells Kabir that she thinks he only used their relationship to get what he wanted. She also says that she feels like he got famous without doing any work, while she worked hard and didn't get recognized. Kabir feels sad and doesn't defend himself, so he starts packing to leave. But then Kia finds a gift that Jaya gave to Kabir for his wife, and a letter from Jaya where she congratulates them and says that it's brave for Kabir to take care of their home instead of working, but it's even harder for Kia to be his wife.

Confused and angry, he leaves his father's home to stay with his friend and is determined to find ""Tara"", and he messages her on Facebook.

His father Raj has seen Seher too and thinks the game is up, but he finds the real ""Tara"" Seher and convinces her to pretend to be Tara and coax his son back home with his friends. Incidentally, Seher is attracted to Kabir after meeting him but is scared to fall in love because of her history. He impresses her, and she falls for him.

As the relationship progresses, Seher and Kabir are together. Seher discloses that she was an obedient daughter till she became pregnant with her boyfriend's baby. She stole money from her house and gave it to him, but he dumped her, ran to Canada and left her estranged from her small-town conservative family in Meerut. She ran away to Delhi, got an abortion and started living single. She wants to go to Meerut, but her parents deny her. She goes with Kabir to celebrate Diwali with his father Raj, and they end up making out in her rented flat.

The next day she secretly meets Raj, who asks her to end the relationship. Seher tells him she has fallen in love with Kabir, but Raj calls her a fraud and insults her while saying she is very different from Kabir. She breaks up with Kabir and starts working hard in the Salon to pay back her debts. Heartbroken, Kabir returns to his father Raj, who asks him to concentrate on his music. Seeing Kabir, Beeji and Raj's friend try to persuade him to help Kabir with Seher, but he insults and rebuffs them.

Unable to sing, a depressed Kabir avoids his band and is not going to band events, leading to his music career suffering. His father pretends to have a heart attack and is taken to hospital by a distraught Kabir. Kabir is furious with his father's constant deception & lies and runs away. Upon returning home, Seher is spotted by Kabir returning his dad's money, and she runs away while Raj's friend gives Kabir the truth.

Raj and his friends go to the girls' hostel to find Seher, where she is staying after clearing the landlord's debt, hoping that she can help find Kabir or know where he is. Using an app, they trace Kabir to a Metro Station, where his father finally has an honest conversation, opening up for the first time. Raj tells Kabir that his mother covered her injuries to ensure that Kabir's exam next day is unaffected. He comes clean about his Facebook deception and other lies, admitting that whatever he did was out of love with the intention to come closer to his son; the two eventually hug. Raj tells Kabir that he has realized that Seher is a wonderful girl and he should go after her and get her back.

Kabir finds Seher, and then they get back together as Kabir's band continues to play in the background. Kabir's band is successful; Seher goes with Kabir to Meerut and reconciles with her family; Seher lives with Kabir in Chandni Chowk, while he sings that his heart and soul belongs in Chandni Chowk. After the performance, Kabir looks at the pigeons and leaves to spend time with Seher and his family and friends.","['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Family']",An internet-rookie father attempts to use social media to enhance his faltering relationship with his millennial son.,"Badhaai ho,Khamoshiyan,Suraj Pe Mangal Bhari,Boss,Roy,Karthik Calling Karthik"

6277462,Brahmastra Part One: Shiva,Action Adventure Fantasy āstra piece astras ansh world Nandi power pieces sages shakti ancient high reveals group,Action Adventure Fantasy energy superpowers ladylove embark mission protect weapon enormous dark forces closing,"In ancient India, high in the Himalayas, a group of sages chanced upon a collision with the potent energy of Brahm-shakti. This cosmic encounter led to the creation of celestial weapons known as astras, among which the Brahmāstra stood supreme. This mighty weapon had the terrifying capability to annihilate the world itself. Recognizing the grave potential for destruction, the sages harnessed their respective astras to subdue the unstable Brahmāstra, and thus, the secret society of Brahmansh was born. Their mission was clear: to safeguard the world from the cataclysmic power of astras.

Fast forward to present-day Mumbai, where Shiva, a DJ, experiences love at first sight when he meets Isha Chatterjee, a London resident visiting India for the Durga Puja festival at her grandfather's pandal. A reciprocal affection blossoms between Shiva and Isha. Shiva reveals his tragic past—being an orphan who never knew his father, and losing his mother in a fire when he was just a baby in 1993.

Simultaneously, in Delhi, a scientist and member of the Brahmānsh secret society, Mohan Bhargav, becomes the target of a sinister duo, Zor and Raftar. They are after a piece of the Brahmāstra that Mohan safeguards. In the ensuing confrontation, Mohan deploys the Vānarāstra but is eventually subdued by Junoon, who works for a mysterious evil entity known as Dev. Under Junoon's control, Mohan reveals that the second piece of the Brahmāstra is protected by an artist and archaeologist named Anish Shetty in Varanasi. However, before he can reveal the current location and leader of the Brahmansh, Mohan leaps to his own death from a balcony.

Shiva receives a vision of Mohan's encounter with Junoon, revealing a mysterious connection involving the Agneyāstra. He and Isha set off for Varanasi to warn Anish, but they are intercepted by Raftar, who now wields Mohan's Vānarāstra. Anish manages to defeat Raftar using the Nandi Āstra before escaping with Shiva and Isha. En route to Himachal Pradesh, where the Ashram of the Brahmansh is located, they find themselves pursued by Junoon and Zor in a menacing chase.

Anish entrusts the second piece of the Brahmāstra to Shiva and stays behind to confront Junoon and Zor, ultimately meeting his demise. Shiva and Isha, while on the run, find themselves relentlessly pursued by Raftar. In a dire situation at the Ashram, Shiva invokes his fire power to defend Isha and eliminates Raftar.

At the Ashram, Shiva and Isha discover the existence of various astras and Shiva is compelled to join the Brahmansh, under the guidance of the guru Raghu. He gains insights into his parents' history, realizing they were former Brahmansh members. Dev was a unique individual who could control multiple āstras simultaneously, and it was his actions that initially awakened the Brahmāstra.

Dev's wife, Amrita, who wielded the Jalāstra, once confronted Dev in a fateful battle on a remote island. Both seemingly perished in the clash, and their boat, recovered from the island's ruins, contained two fragmented pieces of the Brahmāstra. These pieces were entrusted to Mohan and Anish. The whereabouts of the third piece remained unknown, as Raghu and Shiva conclude that both Dev and Amrita somehow survived their battle.

The third fragment of the Brahmāstra is concealed within Amrita's Mayāstra, disguised as a conch shell. Raghu unveils this piece by dropping Shiva's blood on the conch. Junoon and her army descend on the Ashram in pursuit of the Brahmāstra, holding its occupants hostage. Shiva confronts Junoon and manages to defeat her, putting an end to Zor, who wielded Anish's Nandi Astra. Despite the odds, Junoon acquires the third piece from Isha. In a climactic act of sacrifice, she activates the Brahmāstra. The world stands on the brink of destruction, and Isha is in peril. However, Shiva's newfound strength, fueled by his deep love and protectiveness for Isha, enables him to harness the Brahmāstra's power and avert the impending cataclysm, reuniting with his beloved.","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Fantasy']","A DJ with superpowers and his ladylove embark on a mission to protect the Brahmastra, a weapon of enormous energy, from dark forces closing in on them.","Malaal,1920 London,Krrish 3,Shivaay,Rowdy Rathore,Saaho"
15832148,Afwaah,Drama Thriller truck man party henchman police political kill killed inside men video expert hospital,Drama Thriller rumour advertising professional political heiress lives upended viral social media,"Rahab Ahmed  driving down a narrow highway road when a convoy of jeeps owned by a political party nearly pushes him off the road as they speed in the opposite direction. This convoy is led by a man named Chandan Singh , a local political henchman, who soon arrives at his party superior Vicky Singh's  rally. Vicky is an up-and-coming leader of the Rashtriya Vikas Dal, a powerful party in the desert state that is being shown.Vicky's rally on this particular day is at a locality that is predominantly Muslim, but his words are positioned against these very people. The situation gets very tense soon when Vicky is pelted with a few stones, and he has to step down and take shelter inside his car. Chandan spots a helpless Muslim meat seller and enters his shop. Pulling down the shop's shutter in a show of political strength and influence, Chandan then beats the man to death.As the entire rally and the subsequent violence are all recorded by media channels, clips of them are soon released all over the internet. To make matters worse for Vicky, a clip of him telling Chandan to retaliate right before the henchman goes and kills the meat seller goes viral. Although he has the support of his party superior, Gyaan Singh, there is immediate trouble in his personal life. Vicky's fiance, Nivedita , or Nivi, is terribly upset by the violence and hatred that he and his party are part of. Nivi is also the daughter of Gyaan Singh, the woman decides to run away from home. Nivi would find help in Rahab Ahmed, who is driving towards the Nahargarh Fort to attend his wife's book launch.Rahab Ahmed attends a talk conference on his way to Nahargarh. A veteran in the field of advertising and hailed as ""the adman,"" Rahab used to live and work in the United States before returning to India. He claims to have stopped some men from racially heckling an Indian man and his grandson in the US. Rahab's method to do so was to immediately start recording the incident on his smartphone, which stopped the hecklers from disturbing the elderly man. He then believed that he could genuinely do better things in India than in the US or anywhere abroad, and for this reason, he returned to his homeland.
However, much later, Rahab admits to Nivi that this was all a lie. Instead of taking any action against the racist hecklers, Rahab actually got off the bus and was left shaken and scared after the incident.It was out of fear that Rahab had returned to India, where he possibly felt that he would not face any such ostracizing. However, an equally terrible hatred actually comes his way in India, too, because of his identity as a Muslim.
Rahab does actually use the smartphone to save Nivi from Vicky's goons when he sees her for the first time.Vicky Singh is mostly concerned with the state-level politics that he is involved in and dreams of reaching the very top of his regional political party. As a figure respectfully called Bana by his followers, Vicky's aim is clearly to reach the stature of Gyaan Singh, who is venerated as Hukum. The incidents that took place at the rally at the very beginning do create pressure on Vicky, for the police as well as his political superiors, who want his trusted henchman Chandan to be killed. Chandan trusts Vicky and tells him that he is hiding at Vicky's farmhouse.
It is even more shameful that Nivi ran away from him. Vicky gets his men to track Nivi down as well but is unable to get hold of her as she escapes with the stranger, Rahab. While escaping Vicky's goons, Rahab crashes his car.
Nivi convinces Rahab that he is now involved and if they are caught, Rahab would be killed.
Nivi had written a letter to Gyaan blaming Vicky for her running away from the house. Vicky never reveals this letter to Gyaan as he is in the hospital getting surgery.It is then that Gyaan Singh sends an IT expert to Vicky to ease his situation. Videos that had been shot during the altercation with Nivi and Rahab had been procured by the expert and his team, from which the license plate of Rahab's car could be seen. Identifying that the car belonged to a Muslim man, the man suggested that they term the incident a case of ""love jihad."" The IT expert and his team quickly edited the videos to present a narrative that the Hindu Nivi was escaping with the Muslim Rahab because of an extramarital affair, and the helpless Vicky could do nothing as he was overpowered. The narrative also presents Gyaan Singh as a helpless victim, for he had no idea what his daughter had been up to. As Vicky is desperate to track Nivi and, more importantly, to cleanse his image in public, he approves of this plan, and the rumor is spread all over social media.Both Nivi and Rahab face troubles because of this false narrative. Rahab knows only Nivi can save him as she is Gyaan Singh's daughter. When the two take shelter on a university campus as riots rage throughout the city, a young student confronts them about their apparently unlawful
love. Nivi tells the student about how one should not blindly believe everything on the internet.
Nivi and Rahab escape when Vicky's men reach the university. They are recognized by Vicky's henchman on the highway, who fires a shot by mistake and hits Nivi. He runs away in fear.
Nivi has to be taken to the hospital, but nobody helps Rahab. The video about the love jihad is watched by the people, and the hospital staff keep them locked inside until Vicky and his group arrive.A corrupt police inspector named Sandeep Tomar , has a direct relationship with the party officials, and he is quite close to Vicky Singh himself. Although Vicky does not want his henchman Chandan to be harmed, Gyaan Singh directly asks Tomar to get Chandan killed in order to maintain the party's public image. Along with this political pressure, Tomar is also instructed by the DGP to kill Chandan so that the state authorities' strict actions on law and order can be propagated. Finally, as Vicky also accepts this fate for his henchman, Tomar goes to the farmhouse where Chandan has been hiding but mistakenly kills a different man. Chandan realizes that someone is trying to get him killed and runs away.The sister of this slain man reports the murder to the police, and Tomar tries to bury the matter through his subordinate, Riya Rathod . Riya was having sexual relations with Tomar in exchange for her job at the police station. She was tracking Tomar's mobile and knew he was at Vicky's farmhouse. Tomar admits that he was trying to kill Chandan and wants Riya to help him. He asks Riya to kill the sister, so that the man's murder can be covered up.After escaping from the farmhouse and then realizing that it is the police inspector Tomar who is trying to kill him, Chandan gets help from a Muslim truck driver who lets him hide inside his truck. In this desperate moment, the henchman truly does not mind taking help from a man of the minority community, against whom he is generally so hateful.Chandan Singh had been on the run, and he had taken shelter inside a truck in order to travel to a different city. Vicky gets to know of this when he calls Chandan , along with the license number of the truck, and he once again seeks help from the IT expert. It is now Vicky himself who cooks up a false narrative about how the truck is smuggling beef inside its cargo and gets the expert to create a video about this and get it viral on the internet. With the majority of the population enraged by this rumor, hordes of young men get out on the roads, trying to find the truck and stop it.Chandan escapes Tomar multiple times . The Muslim driver is shot by Tomar and dies. Chandan takes over the truck. Tomar calls Riya to pursue Chanda. Chandan realizes now that his location has been compromised twice, and figures that Vicky is trying to get him killed.
Chandan finally reaches the hospital where Nivi and Rahab are being held hostage. Nivi believes that Chandan is there to drive her to Vicky, instead Chandan tells Nivi that Vicky is trying to kill him and wants Nivi to save him. He agrees to drive them to Nahargarh Fort.Rahab uses the smartphone once again when he tells Nivi to record a video about how she was being hunted and persecuted by her fiance and his party workers and put it up on social media.
Chandan Singh claims that Vicky has every right to do anything to Nivi because she is going to be his wife soon, but any such action against her by anybody else is a major crime. Rahab is shocked to hear this, and Nivi remarks that this is exactly how the lives of women in a patriarchal society are.
Vicky knows that Chandan rescued Nivi and driving them to Nahargarh in the truck. He orders the viral truck video to be taken down, but it is already viral. Vicky knows he has to save Nivi himself now as the mob will lynch her.Chandan, Nivi, and Rahab reach the fort, but the lit-fest authorities refuse to let Rahab enter, stating that there was massive unrest in the state because of his actions. They, of course, refer to the fake video stating that Rahab was in a love jihad. Rahab calls his wife, who appeals to the authorities, but nobody is willing to help her or Rahab. Nobody has to courage to save a life.
During this time, Vicky also arrives on the scene and has a confrontation with Chandan. Chandan keeps asking his boss why he wants him dead, and Vicky simply denies the charge, saying that Tomar was working on his own accord. Chandan's is easily convinced by Vicky's lies and chooses to stay faithful to his boss. Vicky orders Chandan to kill Rahab. Chandan proceeds to stab Rahab, gets into a fight with him, and is ultimately found and shot dead by Sandeep Tomar.
Riya breaks up with Tomar and informs him that the sister is alive. If Tomar harasses Riya, she will produce the sister in front of the DGP.On the other side, Vicky gets hold of the truck with Nivi inside and starts driving it away from the fort. But by this time, hordes of violent men, who were all searching for the truck, had found the vehicle and blocked the path. Realizing that they are here to act against the apparently interfaith couple, Nivi embraces Vicky and starts kissing him in full view of the men, and they angrily take Vicky to be the Muslim man running away with the Hindu woman. Vicky is engulfed by the same flame of hatred that he had earlier spread through the rumors, and he is lynched by the angry mob. The next morning, when the police arrive and open up the cargo haul of the truck, it is revealed that the vehicle was only transporting donkeys, and there were no cows or beef at all.Although stabbed by Chandan, Rahab manages to survive the attack with wounds, when he climbs the walls of the fort and drops into the literary fest. He is treated at a hospital. Once fully recovered, Rahab returns home and decides not to shave his beard.On the other hand, Nivi is seen to have become a politician one month later, following the death of her fiance, Vicky. She is now the leader of her father's party and is about to fight for a position in the upcoming elections. Despite having once hated the kind of politics practiced by her father and her fiance, Nivi joins the same profession, perhaps with the hope of bringing better justice to society. Nivi is also seen with Riya, and perhaps she has been promoted to some higher post in the police force.A last scene alongside the end credits shows Rahab and his father seemingly returning to their home, but the building has recently been burned down, possibly by people who were still hateful against Rahab for the love-jihad rumor. But Rahab's father claims that the house needed to be razed down to be rebuilt someday, and Rahab also accepts fate and helps in clearing the rubble.","['Drama', 'Thriller']",An advertising professional and a political heiress whose lives are upended by a viral social media rumour.,"No One Killed Jessica,Satyagraha,Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu,Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster,Jalsa,Satyameva Jayate 2"

Laal's journey begins in 1977 when he is a young boy living in Karoli, Punjab. With an IQ of 75 and leg braces to correct his curved spine, he faces various challenges. Despite these obstacles, Laal's mother encourages him to overcome his disabilities.

Laal's life takes a significant turn when he befriends a girl named Rupa D'Souza on his first day of school, and their friendship blossoms. However, life throws them a curveball when a tragic incident leads to Rupa's father's arrest for the murder of her mother. With Rupa's mother also passing away, she is sent to live with her grandmother, who used to work at Laal's house. This brings joy to Laal as it means they can be together more often. As the 1984 anti-Sikh riots erupt, Laal and his mother seek refuge at his aunt's house in an effort to stay safe. During this time, Laal crosses paths with a young Shah Rukh Khan and teaches him dance moves and poses that he would later incorporate into his films.

To shield Laal from rioters, his mother takes a drastic step. She cuts off his long hair and removes his turban to conceal his identity as a Sikh. Subsequently, Laal's mother sends him and Rupa to Hindu College in Delhi. At the college, Laal bears witness to L.K. Advani's Ram Rath Yatra. While Laal excels in track and field, winning numerous prizes, Rupa pursues her dream of becoming a model in Mumbai to attain wealth.

In 1999, the Kargil War between India and Pakistan breaks out, with both Laal and Bala serving in the same battalion. Rupa advises Laal to run when his life is in danger, a piece of advice that would play a pivotal role later on. During the war, Laal repeatedly returns to help injured soldiers, ultimately saving a Pakistani commander. Tragically, he is unable to rescue Bala, which leaves him heartbroken. Despite this, Laal is awarded a medal by the Indian Government for saving five soldiers.

Rupa, who had previously not responded to any of Laal's letters, has become involved with a gangster who manipulates her and fails to fulfill her dreams. Laal confronts the gangster when he witnesses him mistreating Rupa, expressing his love for her. However, Rupa, believing they have no future together, urges Laal to forget her. In a surprising twist, Laal encounters Mohammed Paaji, the Pakistani commander he had saved during the war, who had escaped from the hospital. The two form a deep friendship, with Mohammed recognizing Laal's purity and innocence, despite his own past as a terrorist.

Laal eventually establishes an undergarment manufacturing company but struggles with marketing. Mohammed Paaji's suggestion to name the brand after a girl, referencing the knitwear company Rupa, leads to a significant boost in sales. The company's success grows, and Laal and Mohammed become prosperous entrepreneurs. Mohammed also invests in the Bombay Stock Exchange, further increasing their wealth. After some time, Mohammed returns to his homeland and opens a school for children, while Laal's mother succumbs to cancer, leaving him alone.

Laal dedicates himself to tending the land left behind by his mother. Rupa returns to stay with him, and they finally acknowledge their feelings for one another. They make love, but Rupa is subsequently arrested by the police due to her association with the underworld. Laal is devastated, unaware of her arrest, and embarks on a marathon run without a specific purpose. The run continues for over four years, with people speculating on the profound reason behind it. Media outlets cover his journey, anticipating an enlightening answer for his long run.

After years of running, Laal unexpectedly stops, and many followers who had joined him seek answers. However, Laal's response is simple: he is tired and yearns to return home.

Upon his return, Laal resumes wearing a turban after many years. To his pleasant surprise, he learns that Rupa had written him numerous letters. He informs his fellow train passengers that Rupa has served her prison sentence and is now residing in Chandigarh. Laal reunites with Rupa and discovers that he is the father of her son, named Aman. They get married, but Rupa succumbs to illness at a later point. Laal assumes the role of caring for Aman and enrolls him in the same school he attended, feeling that his life has come full circle.","['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Romance']","The story of Laal Singh Chaddha, a simple man whose extraordinary journey will fill you with love, warmth and happiness.","Bala,Paan Singh Tomar,Roy,Aa Bhi Ja O Piya,Teri Meri Kahaani,Bhaag Milkha Bhaag"

13795296,Thank God,Comedy Fantasy balls house black due Inspector real estate wife son sister white,Comedy Fantasy GAME LIFE debts meets egoistic real estate broker huge accident.God front informs play win hell back earth,"Ayaan Kapoor  is a real estate businessman who is in debt of Rs 16 Crores. He had a growing real estate business but fell into debt due to his involvement in black money  and subsequent demonetization . His loan application at the bank has been rejected. He wanted to sell his house to repay his debt but could not find any buyer and starts living at his wife's house with his wife, Inspector Ruhi  and daughter Pihu .
Ayaan ignores his mother , and says he is in a meeting, whenever she calls. Ayaan's sister is using her husband's savings to fix her dad's ancestral home. Ayaan knew that his dad loved that home, but doesn't contribution to its renovation. The sister does this as she believes that due to her negligence the house was burnt down. To reduce his sister's guilt Ruhi suggests making a story that the house didn't burn down by Ruhi, Diwali Diya, but by Ayaan's firecrackers. This offends him.
Ayaan is a deeply religious person, but doesn't believe in donations or feeding the needy. Ayaan almost sells the house to a nice couple who wanted to buy it for their adopted son. Ayaan mistakenly reveals this to the son, who had no clue that he was adopted. The son, goes crying to his parents, scuttling the deal.One day, Ayaan gets involved in a road accident, and regains consciousness in Heaven, where the gods Yamaduta YD  and Chitragupta CG  provide him a chance to send him back to Earth by asking him to play a game called Game of Life. In a brief history on Ayaan, we learn that he is 33 years old and wanted to be a police officer when he was a kid. Ayaan is shown that after the accident, he is in surgery and will be there for the next 5 hrs. During that time CG will play his game with Ayaan. If Ayaan refuses to play, he will burn in hell forever.
There are two containers, one to be filled with white balls, which represent his positives, and the other with black balls, which represent his sins and weaknesses. If the white balls fill first, he gets to go back home. If the black balls fill first, he goes to hell. The initial position for Ayaan is very tough as he starts off with a lot of black balls.Ayaan has a short temper, on his honeymoon, he assaulted a fat and irritating person  in the lift, when he needlessly delayed the lift by talking to this wife and pressing extra buttons inside the lift .
Ayaan is accused of being greedy as he leaked his father's  to his friend for rs 2000. Today, that friend is a surgeon and performing the operation on Ayaan.
Next, CG asks Ayaan to negotiate with a corrupt builder to get the right price for the Juhu Bungalow of Mr & Mrs Gaikwad. The builder bought it for Rs 3 Crores, which is far lower than the market price. When Ayaan calls, the builder refuses to negotiate. CG reveals that Ayaan himself was the corrupt builder.Ayaan is shown to be jealous of his wife Ruhi as she's an inspector in the crime branch whereas Ayaan had failed to become an inspector. Ayaan claims that Ruhi never caught any criminal and if he was the inspector, he would have made top cop, a Singham. Chitragupta puts him in a scenario where he's an inspector tasked to save a hostage inside a bank. The hostage is a fellow police office and asks him to shoot through him to kill the terrorist. However, his failure to do so  shows him that the reality is that he couldn't have been a better inspector when compared to Ruhi. In the same situation, Ruhi talks to the terrorist and figures out that his wife died, and his son is in the hospital. He doesn't have money, which is why he is robbing a bank. Ruhi disarms him and asks the bank staff to donate money for his son's treatment. His son was operated on, and he is now living a healthy life.
Ayaan is shown to be the one who believes in God, but he still gets black balls because of his lack of humanity. Ayaan used to visit a Hanuman temple regularly, but it was more of a bribe than faith. Also, he ignored an old woman's plea for food, and she died 30 mins after he left.Later, the game changes when Ayaan finally gets white balls for controlling his anger .
Next Ayaan is given a task to resist his lust by putting him in a room with Nora Fatehi . He can resist the temptation by picturing his mother.
His challenges also include apologizing his elder sister  for falsely blaming her during their childhood of the burning their father's house. In heaven, Ayaan gets beaten by his father  due to which he apologizes to his sister. He wins by earning white balls due to which Chitragupta awards him a check of 18 Crores for the sale of house, something that even Ayaan couldn't do. However, Chitragupta sees Nora's phone number in lipstick on Ayaan's elbow, earning him many black balls.
Chitragupta shows him reality, where his wife and relatives were planning to buy him a new car after hearing that his car would be towed due to his bank loan. But the car which collided with Aayan's car was the new car that Ruhi bought for Ayaan.He returns to earth  where Doctor tells him that Pihu's kidneys are damaged and Ruhi's one kidney was transplanted, but Pihu's body rejected it.

He makes a miserable living as a projectionist in a movie theater and ekes out some additional income pirating movies for a gang of local thugs. Michael is always harangued by his landlord, the drunk and bitter Mr. DCosta, for overdue rent and continues to receive progressively threatening calls from the dead boy's father. His only goal is to get Roy out of the city and into a boarding school, saving money that he moves about his apartment so DCosta cannot find it. Rwitika, Michael's only friend, occasionally looks after Roy and urges him to pick up and move on. Amid this turmoil, he finds a quiet comfort in Mrs DCosta, who generally sympathizes with him and occasionally warns him about her husband.

It is the dead boy's father, who vows to shoot Roy. Michael begs him to stop until Rwitika comes on the line next. Shocked, Michael hangs up the phone and steps into the road where a passing taxicab runs him over and kills him. It is revealed that Michael had been hearing voices all along  since his guilt over the rally slowly drove him insane.

Harry is a wealthy, cynical businessman who dreams of turning the Mandola village  into a shining example of his success and a microcosm of a fledgeling economy in itself, but this dream can only be realized if the villagers agree to sell their land to the government at unfairly low rates in order for the land to be converted into a Special Economic Zone.

Among many vices, a vice relevant to the plot, is Harry's drinking. He is normally a shrewd, sophisticated and composed individual, but whenever drunk, he turns into an advocate of equality and betterment of the villagers, but regrets these thoughts when sober. When he chooses not to drink he hallucinates, as a withdrawal symptom, about a pink buffalo 'Gulabo/Aditi Arora', the mascot of the brand of alcohol he enjoys. The knowledge of these hallucinations are later used by Matru as a ploy to get Harry drunk in order to serve his own plans.

Bijlee Mandola is the only child of Harry Mandola. She lost her mother when she was young and now lives in Mandola village after having received a higher education in New Delhi and later in Oxford, England. Bijlee is now in love with Baadal, the son of politician Chaudhari Devi and is all set to marry him.

Chaudhari Devi is a corrupt politician who, along with her obedients, is helping Harry realize his dream. Baadal and Bijlee's union is strategically apt as it serves Harry's and Chaudhari Devi's personal goals. While Chaudhari Devi conspires to control Harry's wealth by marrying her son to his daughter, Harry seeks Chaudhari Devi's help in realising his dream in exchange for their children's marriage.

Matru is a revolutionary, fighting for the villagers' cause of not letting their land being taken away. He is educated in Law from JNU, holds a job as Harry's driver and is responsible for regulating Harry's drinking. Matru's revolutionary instincts are shown to be significantly influenced by those of Mao Tse-tung.

The film starts with a negotiation at a liquor shop set in crop laden fields, between the liquor shop owner and a heavily drunk Harry. The shop owner's rude refusal to sell alcohol to Harry due to the day being a dry day provokes Harry to run his limousine into the shop.

Once drunk, Harry is shown to be an entirely different individual, who wants the land of the villagers to be returned to them, Matru to marry Bijlee while himself to retire into a religious man.

The villagers, in their fight are supported and advised by Mao who regularly sends messages to the villagers, written on cloth. Later in the film it is revealed that Mao is none other than Matru who is advising the villagers without revealing himself in order to retain the key position as Harry's aide.

Bijlee's love for Baadal is depicted to be a contradiction to her subtle, probably subconscious, knowledge of Baadal's incompatibility with her. This subtle thought aggravated by Baadal's affiliation and deeds supporting his mother's corrupt cause overpowers Bijlee's will to marry him and polarizes her into helping Matru and the villagers instead. After this polarization, seeing Chaudhari Devi and Baadal's ambitions in a new light and while helping the villagers along with Matru, Bijlee falls in love with Matru.

Although they have the help of Matru, his college friends, and Bijlee, the villagers lose their entire harvest to an unexpected rain storm. This harvest, which would have fetched enough money to settle their debts to the government bank and some more for their own survival, is now completely destroyed. Thus the villagers are forced to surrender their land, against their will, to the government in order to settle their debts.

Later, discovering Bijlee's alliance with the villagers, Chaudhari Devi, now cautious, decides to finalize the decree to convert the now acquired land into an SEZ only once Bijlee and Baadal are married.

These conflicts of villagers' loss of their lands, Bijlee's marriage to Baadal, builds up the tension leading up to the wedding at the climax wherein Matru and the villagers have a plan to get Harry drunk who will then call off the wedding. This plan apparently works and Harry is shown to be drunk, succumbing to Matru and the villagers' plan. Now, while drunk, he enters the wedding venue, calls off the wedding, and chases away Chaudhari Devi whilst Baadal and their supporters and decides to get Bijlee and Matru married. Consequently, upon refusal by Matru on the pretext that Harry will not feel the same way about him and Bijlee when sober, Harry, to everyone's surprise, reveals that since he had sworn on Bijlee to not consume even a drop of alcohol has stood by his word, in turn revealing that while he did all that he did appearing to be drunk, he was completely sober instead.","['Comedy', 'Drama']","Harry is an industrialist who loves his daughter Bijlee, and the bond they share with Harry's man friday, Matru. Bijlee's plan to wed the son of a politician, however, brings twists and turns in the lives of Matru, Bijlee and Mandola.","Housefull 4,Jogira Sara Ra Ra,Raat Akeli Hai,Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster 3,Tanu Weds Manu Returns,Paharganj"
4909752,Rangoon,Action Drama History Romance War CARD sword events show bridge film war border back time soldiers star troops troupe,Action Drama History Romance War travels border troops insistence lover soldier perform ends falling love,"In 1943, as the Second World War rages on, India is fighting a combat of her own: independence from British rule. Subash Chandra Bose, founder of the Indian National Army, has become disenchanted with Mahatma Gandhi's Ahimsa  movement and desires to fight fire with fire. Recognizing the growing dominance of Imperial Japanese Army in the Indo-China region, the INA allies itself with the Japanese, hoping to ride the wave to Delhi. Indian troops in the British Indian Army are locked in pitched battles with both the INA and its Japanese contingent. In one such skirmish close to the Indo-Burma border, Jemadar Nawab Malik  and a group of fellow soldiers are cornered by the Japanese infantry. Running to escape on a barge, he is shot and captured as a prisoner of war. Meanwhile, the INA's top brass desperately seeks finances to replenish its heavy ammunition to aid the charge to Delhi.Concurrently in India, Julia  a leading film star of the Indian cinema is the star performer of a dance troupe that entertains civilians and armed forces alike through films espousing her daredevilry. Zulfi  is her butler, make-up man, and trusted confidant. The films are produced by Rustom ""Rusi"" Billimoria , a former Indian action film star whose career was cut short when he lost a hand in a film stunt gone wrong. He is now Julia's mentor and the scion of a production house.Billimoria is on friendly terms with the resident British commander Major General David Harding , who encounters a gem-encrusted royal sword belonging to a Maharajah  at a gathering hosted by Billimoria. Slighted by the commander's arrogant demeanor, the King endeavors to send the sword to Indo-Burma border, where the INA hopes it can fund its artillery and drive the British out of India. An opportunity arises when Harding proposes dispatching Julia and her troupe to the war-torn border where he hopes to raise the sagging morale of his troops through her shows. When Billimoria and Julia  object, Harding promises top-grade security and coerces them by threatening to block supplies of film stock from England, as Hitler-led Germany have stopped shipments. Billimoria's affair with Julia causes rifts in his family, with his wife demanding a divorce and his grandfather concocting a ruse to prevent Billimoria accompanying Julia on the tour.On board the train, Jemadar Malik, who has apparently escaped as a prisoner of war, is assigned as security detail to Julia, much to her chagrin. Crossing a river, the full complement of passengers and boatmen come under fierce Japanese aerial attack, resulting in numerous casualties. The British assume Julia has fallen, but she has survived and is accosted by three Japanese soldiers. Malik, who has also escaped unscathed, arrives in time to save her from being killed and in the process, captures one Japanese soldier Hiromichi  as a hostage to lead them back to the Indian border. Through the rain-drenched jungle and a war-zone swarming with enemy platoons, Julia, Malik, and Hiromichi march slowly to their destination. Combing an anti-aircraft bunker, they barely escape a booby trap, with Malik furious at Hiromichi for leading them into an ambush. As Julia's gentleness and compassion counteracts against Malik's battle-hardened cynicism and aggression, the two fall in love, despite the overwhelming realization their journey will be over when Julia is reunited with Billimoria.Back in India, Harding again proposes that Julia, now engaged to Billimoria, be dispatched to the front-lines, with anti-aircraft gun protection this time. Julia continues to exhibit feelings for Malik: she endorses him for the prestigious Victoria Cross and deliberately forces him to volunteer for a stage show. Billimoria begins to have suspicions about her behavior, which are confirmed after one surreptitious and passionate episode between Malik and Julia during an air-raid.Desiring vengeance, Billimoria volunteers as a stage hand on Julia's next show and after a tense routine, indirectly reveals that he is aware of her infidelity and ready to engage in a fight-to-the-finish with Malik. Meanwhile, Zulfi, who has also survived the earlier raid and is in reality a spy for the INA, has been entrusted to take the sword back to the INA by Mema , an INA agent in the British ranks, and Malik. It is then revealed that Malik did not escape his captivity in Rangoon but was freed by the INA who enlightened him about the evils of British rule in India, thereby enlisting him in the Gandhi regiment of the INA. Convinced of the cause and endowed with a fresh purpose, Malik clandestinely meets Julia before a show and delivers final instructions to Zulfi, who takes up a position outside her tent.Major Williams  racially insults Zulfi after trying to forcibly enter Julia's tent to make her begin the show. Infuriated and inebriated, Zulfi hurls derogatory threats to the British on the radio during Julia's show. The outburst is heard by Billimoria, Harding, and other British soldiers, who rush to uncover the offensive culprit. Zulfi pleads guilty in Julia's presence on the stage but is shot dead by Williams, while Harding discovers Zulfi possessed a British Army officer's pistol. Distraught, Julia protests Billimoria's decision to not give Zulfi a proper burial as another member of Julia's troupe covertly abets Malik in a show of weapon check. As night falls, amid torrential downpour, Julia and Malik give Zulfi a proper burial, musing over loyalties and motivations.During an attempt to arrange a rendezvous for transferring the sword with the INA via a letter, Malik and Mema are caught by Julia, who accuses Malik of betrayal. Torn between his feelings for her and his cause, Malik retorts by saying Julia is blinded by what she sees and the truth is lost on her. The letter reaches the INA, but Mema is trapped by the British while relaying messages. Next day, Harding blackmails Mema into revealing her co-conspirators by threatening to kill her son, at which point Malik discloses his true allegiance. Singing the INA anthem, Malik marches up defiantly to Harding, who signals Williams to shoot Mema dead. Enraged at this callous attitude, Malik lunges at Williams, but is captured and tortured by his former comrades. Horrified at this sequence of events, Julia turns a new leaf: she extracts Malik from a train bound for Delhi and resumes Zulfi's journey in getting the sword to the INA. At the bridge where the sword is to be handed over, Malik and Julia are cornered by the British.Malik convinces Julia to cross the bridge by covering her. In the ensuing gunfight, Malik is seriously injured by mortar fire while Billimoria arrives with British reinforcements. Harding tries to dissuade Julia from crossing the bridge with another false promise, but the mortally-wounded Malik defies him by walking across the bridge, and sacrifices his own life so that Julia can continue. Harding orders the bridge be blown up, causing grave injuries to Julia. Seeking to redeem himself, Billimoria asks Julia for her last wish, who appeals that he continue her task of delivering the sword to the INA before falling to her death. Unsheathing the shining sword, Billimoria massacres the rest of the British troops on the bridge, decapitates Harding, and delivers the sword to the INA. The film ends by proclaiming the INA raised the Indian flag in 1944.","['Action', 'Drama', 'History', 'Romance', 'War']","Julia travels to the Indo-Burma border to perform for the troops during World War II on the insistence of her lover Billimoria, and ends up falling in love with a soldier there, Jemadar.","Paltan,Raazi,Uri: The Surgical Strike,Romeo Akbar Walter,Thugs of Hindostan,Hate Story IV"

5785116,Begum Jaan,Action Drama History named time friends women leave woman hurt back place run house makes home,Action Drama History story refuse part brothel partition,"After that, the movie takes us back to a long time ago in 1947. That was the year when India became independent from the British. The last British ruler in India, Mountbatten, gave a man named Cyril Radcliffe the job of dividing India into two parts - India and Pakistan. Radcliffe drew two lines on a map, one in the Punjab region and another in Bengal. These lines were called the Radcliffe Line.

Begum Jaan is a woman who runs a house where some women live and work. These women were not wanted by their families, so Begum Jaan took care of them. She has some helpers, like an older woman named Amma, a worker named Sujeet who brings customers, and a guard named Salim. They also have two dogs. Some government officers come and try to make them leave the house because it is on land that the government needs. Sujeet and Rubina fall in love with each other. Raja Sahib helps take care of the house and pays the taxes. Begum Jaan asks Raja Sahib for help, and he comes with gifts. He promises to help them, but he wants to spend the night with a young woman named Shabnam who has had a hard time. Begum Jaan tells Shabnam that she has to do this, and Begum Jaan sings while it happens.

Begum Jaan and her team were asked to leave their home, but they didn't want to go. So, Hari and Ilyas asked a scary person named Kabir to frighten them. Kabir even hurt Begum's dogs and gave their meat to her and her friends. Then, someone named Raja Sahib came and said they had to leave. Begum was sad because she thought Raja Sahib would help them. But she said she would rather die in her home than be homeless. Because of what Kabir did, Begum decided to teach her friends how to fight. They practiced a lot. Then, Kabir killed someone named Sujeet and told the other girls to run away. This made Begum and her friends very angry.

Meanwhile, there is a teacher named Masterji who has strong feelings for Begum Jaan, a lady he likes. But there is another lady named Gulabo who also likes Masterji. However, when Masterji asks Begum Jaan to marry him, she says no and tells him to go away. This makes Masterji very angry, so he comes up with a plan to hurt Begum Jaan. He convinces Gulabo to leave the place they live and go away, but then he doesn't treat her nicely and makes bad people hurt her. This makes Gulabo very upset and she promises to get back at Masterji.

That night, a man named Kabir and his friends attacked a place where some women lived. Laadli, her mother, and Shabnam had to run away and were chased by a policeman named Shyam Singh. He wanted something from them, but when Laadli took off her clothes, it reminded him of his own daughter and he felt sad. The women at the place tried to fight back, but they couldn't win. Then, another woman named Gulabo came back and killed a man named Masterji. But she was hurt by Masterji's friends and she died. Kabir and his friends set fire to the place, and the women inside tried to fight, but many of them died. In the end, Begum Jaan and four other women smiled as they saw their home burn. They went inside and closed the doors, and they died in the fire. This is similar to the story of Rani Padmavati, who also chose to die instead of being captured by the enemy.

At the end of the movie, Ilyas and Hari feel really sorry for what they did. Ilyas hurts himself and we see that the brothel is destroyed, which means the Begum Jaan's story has come to an end. In the present time, we find out that the old lady is actually Laadli. She takes off her clothes to protect the couple, and when the bad guys see this, they get scared and run away. Then, the very old Laadli helps the injured couple to leave.

Gopal Tiwari, a police officer with the Mumbai Police, is in a shady hotel having a gala time with a woman, and his colleague and friend Paaji is at the same hotel waiting for Gopal. They are confronted by Narayan Khobre, a local politician and gang leader who is also a drug mafia kingpin, for giving away time to his rival drug supplier. Initially, Paaji and Gopal deny making any deal with the rival man, but Narayan has his ways of knowing and making people tell the truth. Narayan is not alone; he has brought his full force to make sure Gopal reveals what exactly he is doing to gain extra money from Narayan’s rival gang. Gopal and Paaji are corrupt police officers. They are taking a percentage of the profit that drug suppliers like Narayan and his rival gang, Surti, make to make sure no police officer of their rank or working with them would dare arrest these two people. Narayan threatens to kill Gopal and Paaji when Gopal reveals that he has taken a hefty amount from Surti as well to make their business run smoothly without any police bothering him. Because Surti entered the market, Narayan’s business has gone into the red, and to make sure it does not fall further, he forces Gopal and Paaji, as a punishment, to kill Surti. Gopal and Paaji work around Surti’s circle of friends and acquaintances, it won’t be that difficult to infiltrate and assassinate him. Though they are seemingly successful in assassinating the said man, unfortunately, Surti is in a coma and has not died due to the gunshot wounds. Gopal, out of sheer cockiness, ends up stealing the drugs worth two crores from Surti’s place. Unfortunately for the duo, they are arrested for the possession of drugs and taking bribes from Narayan and Surti. Paaji and Gopal are suspended, but they are looking for a way to make sure their suspension is revoked. Gopal comes from a corrupt background and makes sure he will get the money he is seeking; he has no plans to do the right thing. He would have no problem pursuing whichever course of action would serve his purpose, one of which was taking money from the drug mafia to live a lavish life. Paaji, though, is a conflicted man.Thirteen years ago, he was a police officer at a police station in a Naxal-dominated area. Laxmi Sharma, a Naxal leader, was arrested and sexually assaulted by Paaji’s colleagues inside the jail when her comrades attacked the station and rescued her. Paaji, who tried to help and make sure she was not harmed, was not killed in the ambush. She offered him a grenade in case he ever wants freedom from the life he is leading. Her words stayed with her because ever since then, all he has done is make sure he listens to his superiors without understating the consequences of their actions. Gopal is his senior at work, and Paaji still feels suffocated to be doing the same corrupt work for years. Paaji was not keen on picking up the drugs from Surti, but he was forced by Gopal to do so. This shows Paaji is forever conflicted about whether to do the right thing or not. In the hope of getting their suspension revoked, they approach Pammi Sandhu, Paaji’s old friend, to help them sort out the mess. Pammi agrees to help, but she, being a corrupt cop, wants money out of this arrangement. She demands one crore, which is beyond Gopal and Paaji’s reach, but not before she meets Pammi’s friend, who works with a private security agency that deposits money at ATMs around the city. This sparks an idea in Gopal, and he now knows how to make sure to get himself the money required to get him back to work with Pammi’s help. Gopal only knows how to talk about money, and he thinks this is the only way to sort out the matter he’s got himself into. There is no other way he is aware of that will get him out of this bad situation. Money talks, and he is now making a plan to get himself enough money to get himself out of this mess.

Plan Two
Lovely Khobre is the only daughter of drug mafia kingpin Narayan Khobre, and she is engaged to marry a local real estate magnet’s son. Coming from a mafia family that is extremely protective of her, she is raised with plenty of restrictions, and that continues even after she becomes an adult. Lovely is an educated girl, but she is given no freedom to live the life she wants. She was protected and sheltered from the world outside the walls of her home. This time she is heading to her would-be husband’s home after marriage. Enjoying her last few days of freedom, she is headed to meet her friend in another part of the city. Her brother and father make sure she is accompanied by their henchman, Danny. Danny is supposed to take care of and safeguard Lovely and make sure she never gets into trouble because of her family. Keeping in mind the family she belongs to, Lovely tends to be surrounded by security, which again restricts her freedom of movement.On the way to Vashi, it is revealed that Danny and Lovely are in love with each other. The amount of time they have spent together, especially Danny protecting Lovely all the time, and their proximity have led to the love they have for each other. Lovely also feels like the entitled daughter of an influential father, but she also feels that all her life, she has been stopped from having a life on her own, which includes her being unable to choose a life partner for herself. That is why she fell in love with Danny, because this will help her get control of her life. Danny, on the other hand, is not financially capable of taking care of her, and he knows her family would kill them for thinking of living together for years to come. Lovely proposes the idea of moving to Canada, claiming to know someone who can help them. All they must do is deposit the money with the person, and then Lovely and Danny can smoothly shift to Canada. With no money in their hands, Lovely had noticed Gopal at her home asking for weapons from her father, claiming he had a way of getting the money.

Plan Three
Paaji is in a weird headspace after hearing Gopal Tiwari threaten to throw him under the bus if Paaji ever tries to become a witness for the police. At the nick of time, he is again contacted by Pammi because of the three weapons makers she arrested, as they are taking his name to make sure they are released. Paaji’s discovery upon reaching Pammi’s office reveals that these weapon makers were the makers and suppliers of guns and ammunition to the police to tackle the Naxals. Paaji is not keen on speaking on behalf of the weapon makers, but Pammi has already filed an FIR alleging that an Uttar Pradesh minister’s murder weapon was designed by them. Since he gets involuntarily involved in this, Paami forces him to be part of the case. The weapon makers offer the money they have made from the business they have created for themselves. Pammi is not keen on that meager amount, but soon one of the culprits claims to know someone who is the driver for a security company that drops money at the ATMs around the city. Pammi and Paaji force the driver to come along with them with the promise that the money in the van will be equally divided amongst all the conspirators. Since Pammi is helping him get the suspension revoked, Paaji is forced to help her sort this matter out. Paaji is keen on getting his suspension revoked, and they form a plan to get him out of the van to get the money. Paaji has no option but to help Pammi get hold of the money. The money will help him get his job back, and Pammi will regain the trust she has in him from now on. Paaji always wanted to do the right thing, but all he has done so far has been against the system and the law. He is hoping that after this mission, he will be a clean cop.","['Action', 'Comedy', 'Crime', 'Thriller']","A van carrying crores of cash. One rainy night in the outskirts of Mumbai.

Sharbati is unhappy about Jerry's job, though she is determined to continue the job as she can earn more money there and can live a comfortable life. Rinku, a local derp, stalks Jerry even though she is uninterested in him. Tenzin is Jerry friend and help in her mother business.

One day, Sharbati gets ill and is diagnosed with stage two lung cancer and 25 lakh rupees is needed for her medical treatment and chemotherapy. One day, jerry accidentally help police nab a drug smuggler. Inspector Lal thanks her for catching him. The smuggler's boss, Timmy, and his henchmen, Mohinder ""Daddu"" Singh Chandal and Jigar, confront Jerry outside the market. Timmy tells Jerry to bring the hidden stash of drug from inside the market. With Cherry being taken hostage by Jigar, a frightened Jerry manages to retrieve the drugs amidst police security. While returning home, Jerry discovers that Cherry has stolen the smuggler wallet and money. She thinks overnight and decides to smuggle drugs to earn more money for her mother's treatment.

Over the next day, Jerry locates Timmy's place and asks him to consider her for the job as she badly needs money. Timmy at first hesitates but ultimately agrees to keep her as he is infatuated with her. He also convinces his boss Daler to give Jerry the job. He directs her to supply the drugs to a fish factory owned by Ram Malik by hiding it within noodles in a tiffin box. Quickly enough, she becomes an expert and begins to earn more than the men, using the money to treat Sharbati who she has told that her boss sanctioned a loan. One day, Jerry sees Inspector Lal in the massage parlour and suffers a nervous fit, but it turns out that he is the owner's husband. Meanwhile, one of Timmy's henchmen snitches Jerry out to Inspector Lal. Consequently, a police officer searches Jerry on the bus she has boarded and finds drugs in the tiffin box but dismisses it, as he is later revealed to work for Timmy, who discovers the traitor's identity using one of his other men's, but kills both on Jerry's request. Shaken and traumatized, she tells Timmy about not wishing to continue and asks him to pay her dues. Timmy tells her to come the next day. When Jerry goes there to settle the dues, an enraged Timmy says she is very selfish and asks her to give him a body massage. When he tries to take advantage on Jerry, she pushes him away and escapes, leaving him paralyzed.

Jerry returns home to elope with her family but finds Daddu, Jigar and the rest of Timmy's henchmen already holding Sharbati and Cherry captive. Daddu calls Daler, who informs Jerry that she is good to earn her freedom back in exchange for a grand delivery worth 100 kilograms of cocaine. Jerry agrees to do so and hatches a plan with her family and Anil. As part of the plan, Sharbati fakes illness the next day and Jerry and Cherry pretend to ask for help. However, just when the plan seems to work fine with Jigar and a henchman driving the minivan into the area, Rinku intercepts the gang and offers to help Jerry. Eventually, they pick up Sharbati along with the bed, and get her on the minivan. On the way, Rinku learns that they are smuggling drugs which are actually hidden beneath the bed, causing him to lose his composure. They somehow escape a police check, faking Sharbati's illness, and arrive at the fish factory to deliver the drugs and leave. However, Daler soon learns that only 10% of the consignment was actual cocaine, and the rest was salt. Aware of the realization that she and her family, along with Anil and Rinku, would be killed at the end of the consignment delivery, Jerry reveals to Daler that she is safe as long as they can't figure out the location of the rest of the drugs. Malik catches Jerry and her family along with Anil and Rinku yet again and Jerry discloses another location, though it soon turns out that instead of salt, it was just refined sugar.

While being tortured for their bluff by Malik's man, Jerry and the others, shortly after killing their captor, bump into Inspector Lal and seek his help for caputuring the gang in exchange for her freedom. They convene at Timmy's restaurant, where Daler and his men take everyone hostage, with enraged Daler hitting Jerry everywhere. Jerry's friend Tenzin and his gang reach there with the drugs, but yet again, it turns out to be fine flour; in the meantime, Inspector Lal and his team fight back. After a shootout, all the gang members except an injured Timmy are shot dead. The police seizes the place and Jerry is about to return home, but is interjected by Inspector Lal who demands that she come with him to the police station. Jerry reminds him of their deal but he rebuffs her. Out of options, Jerry tells him that he would never know the real location of the drugs in the event of an arrest, which, as it turns out, is revealed to be his own house, where an almirah due for movement was stashed with the drugs. Helpless, he allows Jerry to walk free, after which she is seen leaving the place with her family and Anil, reciting the fact that, to survive in this world, all one needs is a little bravery.","['Comedy', 'Crime', 'Drama']","The film is the official remake of Tamil movie Kolamaavu Kokila, which tells the story of an innocent girl who gets pulled into the notorious world of cocaine smuggling.","Lakshmi,Udta Punjab,Coolie No. 1,Gangubai Kathiawadi,Kahaani 2,Mardaani"

Getting bribes from some local thieves and a jeweller, Simmba enjoys and takes full advantage of the lifestyle of a corrupt cop.

Simmba is soon transferred to the Miramar police station in Goa by Home Minister Vinayak Dutta , where he sees Shagun Sathe  and falls in love with her at first sight. He meets his fellow policemen and one of his juniors, Nityanand Mohile , who is an honest constable, hesitates to salute Simmba as he's a corrupt cop. To prove his worth in Miramar, he interrupts a pub party run by an influential gangster named Durva Yashwant Ranade 's brothers, Sadashiv ""Sada"" Ranade  and Gaurav ""Giri"" Ranade  and demands more money from them, whilst promising that he will let them continue with their illegal activities.

Durva agrees and uses Simmba to free the land of an old person named Vaman Rao , who is forced to sign the papers by Simmba. Meanwhile, Simmba develops motherly and sisterly bonds with several women and girls, one of whom happens to be Aakruti Dave , a young woman who reminds Simmba of his teacher. Aakruti files a complaint against Sada and Giri for dealing illicit drugs in their pub and using children as peddlers. Simmba initially ignores this after being pacified by Durva, and Shagun, in the meantime, falls in love with him.

Meanwhile, Aakruti learns about the drug racket in the club and goes there one night with Chhotu, a mute boy who's her student. She videotapes everything there by her cell phone to show evidence to the police but is caught by Sada and Giri. Chhotu discreetly records Sada and Giri assaulting Aakruti and flees once both of them realize. Aakruti is brutally raped by Sada and Giri.

In the court, Simmba is shocked to find Aakruti's video being deleted. He beats up Durva's friend, Corporator David Cameron , who gave a false statement in the court, leading to his suspension orders. He decides to kill Sada and Giri before he goes, and plans to show it as an encounter. He shoots them both and shows as if he killed them in the act of self-defence. An SIT committee is set up by the state, who question Simmba's encounter.

Gunjan wants to look out of the airplane window, but Anshuman doesn't let her. A kind air hostess tends to the problem and takes Gunjan to the cockpit. Looking at the cockpit immediately sparks a desire in her mind to become a pilot as she feels enthusiastic about the plane's features.

A few years later, Gunjan is congratulated for her academic excellence with her proud parents, Anup and Kirti, planning to send her to high school. Gunjan, however, wants to drop out of high school to become a pilot. Anshuman feels that women should not be in the cockpit, but in kitchen making food for the family, but Anup strongly disagrees. A firm believer of gender equality, he allows Gunjan to experiment with her desire to become a pilot. Gunjan makes multiple attempts, but these are thwarted by concerns regarding her educational qualifications and high costs, causing her to return home dejected each time. While her parents differ in their outlook towards her dream, with Kirti hoping her daughter would soon be wary and Anup insistent on allowing his daughter to pursue her dreams relentlessly, an advertisement in a newspaper for acceptance into the Indian Air Force provides Gunjan just the right opportunity for making an effort to enter the air force. Anshuman, who is himself serving in the army, completely disapproves and tells Gunjan that the Air Force isn't a place for women. She, however, ignores him, and goes ahead with the formalities, later finding out on the day of the results that she is the only female who got accepted.

During her medical tests, Gunjan learns that she is one centimeter too short and seven kilograms too much for the Air Force requirements. She is devastated by this, but learns that she can take a retest in two weeks, and discusses it with Anup, who asks her not to give up, and together they come up with a workout regime to lose weight. Across the retest, she still falls short on the height criterion, but the officers conclude that the length of her hands and legs would compensate for it, and accept her into the force. However, while Anup and Kirti are unable to contain their pride, Anshuman still remains in denial of his sister's dedication, but Gunjan decides to ignore his reservations and commences training. During her training, she finds herself subjected to several harsh realities and inconveniences due to the male-dominated order of the air force, and contemplates leaving the camp, when a crisis situation causes her to reconsider when, in 1999, the Kargil war begins, and all Air Force pilots are needed. Gunjan is determined to take part in the war, and despite Anshuman meeting her and dissuading her from participation, disregards his reservations yet again. She finds herself badly needed in a mission and proceeds with it, but is then ordered to abort because the mission is too difficult for her. She reluctantly resigns to the camp. Suddenly, news of army soldiers being heavily wounded in the battle arrives, and it is up to her to save them.

Gunjan and another pilot take separate helicopters and go over to aid the injured soldiers. Back at the camp, army soldiers ask her to abort the mission but regardless of their opinion, she proceeds. Suddenly, as the other helicopter gets shot down from an RPG attack, Gunjan rescues the other pilot and the wounded soldiers and successfully completes a risky maneuver, despite being exposed to bullets herself. After the mission and the war, she is rewarded for her courage and bravery, with Anup feeling proud of her.","['Action', 'Biography', 'Drama', 'War']",Inspired by the life of a fearless young officer who made history by becoming the first Indian female Air Force officer to fly in a combat zone during the 1999 Kargil War,"Rashmi Rocket,Chor Nikal Ke Bhaga,Bellbottom,Saand Ki Aankh,Code Name: Tiranga,Shakuntala Devi"

After proposing marriage and being rejected by Pooja, a girl who he dearly loves, he then gets punched by her elder brother telling him to stay away from her. Aarush goes to London to stay for some time with his best friend, Bob and his wife, Hetal. Bob is a romantic person and loves his wife very much, both working at a casino owned by Kishore Samtani. Although at first, Hetal is unhappy with Aarush's presence, he proves to be a kind-hearted man looking for a family. Bob and Hetal decide to get him married to their boss' daughter, Devika Samtani. After the marriage, on their honeymoon in Italy, Devika leaves him for her longtime American boyfriend Benny. Aarush decides to commit suicide by drowning in the sea but is saved by a girl, Sandy, whom he kisses when she tries to make him breathe by giving him CPR.

Sandy originally thinks Aarush is a pervert but when Aakhri Pasta, the owner of Italy's ""biggest"" hotel where Aarush was spending his honeymoon with Devika, tells Sandy that Aarush is a widower as a joke and his wife died the day of their honeymoon, she befriends him and slowly falls in love with him. What she doesn't know is that Pasta was only joking. Aarush calls Bob and Hetal to Italy telling him about the entire situation. Sandy then tells them that she helped Aarush after the death of his ""wife"", both misinterpret the situation that Aarush lied to Sandy about the dead wife. Aarush later meets Devika and asks for divorce paper leading Sandy to find out his wife is alive and leave him. She does not allow Aarush to enter her room so he climbs her balcony. Pasta thinks Aarush is committing suicide again and a live telecast is conducted. Sandy then switches on her TV and goes to her balcony but later when Aarush manages to clear the confusion, she accepts him.

The only way Aarush and Sandy can get married is by convincing her elder brother, Major Krishna Rao, a strict Indian Military Intelligence officer who loves his sister and is over-protective of her. Meanwhile, Hetal lies to her father, Batuk Patel, that Bob owns a mansion and they have a child, so she can meet him after so many years. On the other hand, Sandy tells her brother that Aarush is quite well to do too. The four are then forced to rent a mansion to make Hetal's dad believe that Bob owns it. Confusion prevails and somehow Batuk accidentally believes that Aarush is married to Hetal, and Bob is the cook. In the confusion, they bring an African child and pretend that it is the baby. Then, Krishna turns up earlier than expected, and much to Aarush's horror, Krishna was the one who punched him earlier for Pooja, leading to more lies and the two couples making him believe that Aarush owns the mansion.

For half of the term, the four must pretend that the mansion is owned by Bob, and the rest must pretend that Aarush owns it. Batuk and the Landlady are Aarush's pseudo parents while Hetal is his sister and Bob is his brother-in-law. An overly suspicious Krishna goes to the casino as his bag was exchanged with Kishore Samtani. Krishna then sees Bob and Hetal working at the casino and as soon as they spot Krishna, they hide from him. Krishna then uses a lie detector on Aarush to find the truth. But Sandy interrupts and proves with the detector that he loves her and Krishna forgives them. The whole family is invited to the Royal Palace to see Krishna get rewarded by the Queen of the United Kingdom. While this is happening, two workers, Santa and Banta Singh, are meant to be installing air conditioning gas for the place. However, instead, they accidentally supply the hall with laughing gas  causing everyone to break into an outburst of laughter. During this laughter, the truth is let out but no one seems to be in the right state of mind.

The two workers meanwhile stop the gas from spreading – everyone comes back to their senses. Aarush goes on stage to reveal the truth to Krishna about his ill fate and believes his engagement with Sandy is now broken. Krishna though believes Aarush is no longer a jinxed loser and instead orders him and Sandy to get married. In the end, Hetal and Bob live together with Batuk, who then marries the Landlady, and Aarush's luck changes for the better. After a song, Aarush says that nobody is a loser.","['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Romance']","Believing himself to be jinxed, a man attempts to find true love, but instead gets caught in a web of lies.","Brij Mohan Amar Rahe,Housefull 4,Blood Money,Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster 3,Shuddh Desi Romance,Aashiqui 2"

Vikram returns home, where his father Pratap Kapoor  and stepmother Romila Kapoor  live and he left for years. Radhika also frequently visits his house to take care of Vikram.

Police suspects Sarah did not die of suicide, but of murder, and they take Vikram as a prime suspect, because the bullet that killed her is from Vikram's gun it belongs to Vikram's father Pratap. All though Pratap had already reported its loss. It was a different gun at the scene. Vikram is now meeting some accidents in his house that nearly killed him. The accidents however were arranged by his stepmother Romila, who wants herself and her blood daughter Nandini to succeed Pratap's assets.

A flashback shows Sarah and Vikram had a one-night stand, after which Sarah, though engaged to Jimmy  already, wanted to be Vikram's girlfriend. After being refused, upset Sarah shot herself in an underground garage. Vikram was shocked and realized no witness would prove his innocence if Sarah was found dead there. So he loaded her ""body"" in the car and drove her to her house, where her dead body was later found.

At the present night, Vikram accidentally sees Romila's ex-boyfriend Narang Kapoor  sneaks into his house to secretly meet Romila, implying that the two had planned together those accidents in the house that nearly killed Vikram. Moreover, he has a strong feeling that someone around is secretly monitoring him.

Jimmy is another prime suspect of Sarah's death because he was seen in CCTV footage escaping from Sarah's house, right after gunshot was heard and soon Sarah's body was found.

The existing part of CCTV footage also shows Sarah was alive after Vikram drove her home, but the Jimmy shows up there, and learns they have an affair. Jimmy and Vikram then had a fight, short before the gunshot was heard.

Pratap, Romila and Nandini leave for a cruise trip, leaving Vikram at home alone. The night they left, a masked man, apparently Narang, enters Vikram's house to attack and kill him. Paralyzed Vikram tries his best to escape from him, and calls his girlfriend Radhika for help, who later arrives. However, Vikram is finally caught by him and Radhika cannot save him because she cannot defeat the attacker.

Police Inspector Roy arrives Vikram's house at the crucial moment, and shoots the masked attacker. To everyone's shock, he is not Narang, or Jimmy, but his father Pratap, who is supposed to be in a cruise trip with family.

Roy now reveals the story: Sarah called Pratap to inform him that she found his lost gun, asking him to visit her house to claim it. When Pratap arrived, he witnessed Vikram and Jimmy fighting each other, so he shot Sarah to frame Vikram, the two then escaped from the house to avoid suspicion. Roy learnt this only after he arrested Jimmy, who told him this story. Pratap did not go to the cruise trip, but instead, found an excuse and returned home. At the end, it is revealed that Vikram never lost his legs; he, along with his doctor, planned and acted handicapped to avenge his mother's death.

Malti is looking for employment, and Amol employs her at his organization.

In April 2005, Malti is attacked with acid in a busy market street in New Delhi. The police investigate – based on Malti's and her boyfriend Rajesh's testimony, they suspect Basheer ""Babbu"" Khan, a family friend of Malti's, and his brother's wife Parveen Shaikh. The police arrest Babbu after triangulating his phone signal in the same area as the attack, while Malti undergoes a series of surgeries to reconstruct her severely damaged face. Malti's parents work as domestic help in Shiraz's house; she helps financially with Malti's treatment and hires Archana Bajaj to be her lawyer.

Archana notes that acid attacks and burning someone with hot water come under the same section of the Indian Penal Code, so the punishment will be the same. In the first hearings, it is clear that Babbu and Parveen are guilty, as Malti's story is corroborated by witnesses and Parveen has the tell-tale burnt fingers from throwing the acid. However, as the law doesn't treat acid attack as a serious crime, Babbu is able to make bail and continue on with his life. Malti recognizes the need for a change to the law and regulations on acid sale, and she and Archana prepare a petition. Meanwhile, Malti's brother Rohit is diagnosed with advanced intestinal tuberculosis.

In August 2009, the court sentences Basheer Khan to 10 years and Parveen Shaikh to 7 years of imprisonment, but they appeal to the High Court. Malti collects funds for treatment and legal action for other acid attack survivors. She eventually succeeds in having the penal code amended. In 2013, another acid attack in Mumbai claims the life of Pinky Rathore, which leads to public outrage and regulations on acid sale. Malti becomes the face of acid attack survivors and develops feelings for Amol.

It is revealed that Basheer planned the acid attack on Malti in jealousy, and carried it out with help from Parveen. In October 2013, the Delhi High Court rejects Basheer's appeal, keeping the attackers in jail. The film ends with another acid attack in December 2013, and laments that despite the new regulations and media exposure, the frequency of acid attacks has not decreased, while acid is still bought and sold freely in India.

The film is based on the real-life story of acid attack survivor Laxmi Agarwal.","['Biography', 'Drama']","The trials and triumphs of Malti, an acid attack survivor.

Once upon a time, there were three men who were feeling really mixed up and sad. One day, they all happened to meet on a bridge and saw a bus driving by with a big picture of their faces on it. The picture was talking about something called a vasectomy, which they didn't know anything about. It turned out that someone had used their pictures without asking and made them look bad. So, they decided to work together and find out who did it, so they could fix the problem.

They later discover that two people who work for the government's health department organized the promotion that caused the problem. They find these two people and ask them to take down all the posters in the city with their pictures on them, even though they didn't have permission to use those pictures. They also ask for the two people to say sorry to the public and give them something to make up for what happened. The two people agree to do these things, but ask for some time to get it all done.

They have tried many ideas such as a horror themed restaurant, A scare based singing show, birthday parties for kids with ghost uncle and bhoot-tube.
They stay at a rented house where they always pray to their close friend 'Raka' to help them alleviate their poverty through a statue of Raka that they had obtained while digging across a hill. One fine day they decide to host a ghost Halloween party at midnight after seeking permission from Raka and they make arrangements for the same. At midnight, Raka's glowing eyes suddenly shut down. In order to mend Raka's eyes, Major and Gullu illuminate the light source of the eyes by connecting it to a live wire. Unfortunately both of them are electrocuted during this maneuver, and fall unconscious to the ground.During their state of unconscious, they enter into a different realm of the dead altogether, where they happen to meet Ragini , a benevolent ghost who promises to help them achieve their desires and wealth in return for a favor that she would ask them to do later on, which they aren't supposed to refuse at any cost. Ragini reveals that she is a ghost.
While coming back from the party, the duo hits Chikni Chudail  on the road. As she lays unconscious, the duo notice that her feet are backwards and they to fix it by turning her feet around. But the feet keep springing back into the original position. Ragini watches this secretly, that the guys were not scared or disgusted by the Chudail. The guys like Ragini's plan, but don't like the fact that they will be defrauding people, as Ragini pretends to enter their bodies as a ghost and Major & GUllu would act as exorcists to get her out.. They want to be legit ghost-busters.
when Major & Gullu explain their plan to be ghost-busters to their parents, they are both ridiculed. Their parents demand the money that they spent on their educations, which comes to rs 5 crores . If they fail to repay the amount in 3 months, they would have to give up the ghost business forever.
Major & Gull set up their entire operation and start their company. They don't get a single client in many days. A lady then calls saying her daughter is acting weird. They go to her home, excited to have their first case and find a little girl, Dolly, locked in her room, and flying around, possessed by a demon.

The guys ask for Rs 10 lakhs as fee and give the entire amount to Lavanya's parents. Lavanya leaves the mortal realm, in peace.Mesmerized by Ragini's beauty and charm, both Major and Gullu fall flat for her and agree to help with her business deal. The deal was to help attain moksha  for depraved souls by exposing the criminals who had wronged those souls while they were living. In return for this favor, both Major and Gullu would earn a lump-some amount of money and they contribute a certain proportion of their earned money to the families of those depraved souls, so that the souls are satisfied and they attain salvation.Inspired by Ragini's idea both Major and Gullu start their own ""Phone Bhoot"" company and Ragini helps them in their business. Their business eventually grows and the phone bhooth company attains enormous fame. This is envied by Atmaram , an evil Tantrik who learns of the Phone Bhoot company and plans to destroy them by summoning certain witches and ghosts. Atmaram uses depraved souls to perform evil tasks for him, in exchange for salvation. But instead of salvation, Atmaram would only capture their souls in a bottle, and keep them in storage forever, and hidden from the other depraved souls still working for him. Rahu  & Ketu  are his minions.
Ragini senses that Atmaram has figured out Gullu & Major's location. She tells them her story. She was a doctor and met Raja Dushyant Singh when he was injured in a polo match. Dushyant proposes to Ragini, but soon after both are hit badly in a road accident. Ragini died. Dushyant went into depression and now has decided to commit suicide at the same spot where Ragini died.

Atmaram senses that the trio are entering his area.Atmaram's attempts to harm Major and Gullu  ) are thwarted by Ragini. Soon Atmaram learns that this ghost Ragini who is protecting both Major and Gullu is none other than the deceased lover of the late king ""Raja Dushyant Singh""  and both were murdered on the highway through a car crash which was actually an evil plot designed by none other than Atmaram himself in order to end Dushyant's reign as king and thereby confiscate his power and wealth. So Atmaram captures Ragini in a bottle during the day of lunar eclipse using his evil Tantrik powers as Ragini's powers were weakened during that time.
After the capture of Ragini, both Major and Gullu feel dejected and deceived because they lately realize that Ragini had used them to their advantage and manipulated them to seek revenge on Atmaram for the murder of her lover Dushyant whose soul was now held captive by Atmaram in his treasury of magic bottles.When they are about to part ways, they are confronted by another benevolent ghost whom they had liberated during one of their past exorcisms using Ragini's help. This ghost reveals to them that Ragini is in dire trouble and requires their help for one last time in order to free many souls from the trap of Atmaram including that of Dushyant. On learning this, both Major and Gullu enter Atmaram's cave and confront him in a severe magical battle where they deceive him through sinister tricks and liberate Ragini and Dushyant who in turn liberate the other souls that are trapped. The combined powers of all the souls then manage to push Atmaram to the underworld where he is caught up in hell fire.

10919304,Hurdang,Drama Romance wanted Minister students bro told opportunity protest knew decided delegation political side married reservation asked,Drama Romance Back aspiring starts reservation rebellion caste-based,"Its 1990. Daddu Thakur , at times, felt overwhelmed by the association he shared with the student leader, Loha Singh . Everybody around him knew that he was being used by Loha for his political benefits, but Daddu believed in him. Loha, on the other hand, knew that Daddu could be really useful for him and his political endeavors, and that is why he was more than cordial with him. Daddu was always at loggerheads with Gopal, Loha's younger brother. Gopal was not as foresighted as his elder brother. He didn't understand why his brother always took Daddu's side. It frustrated him, but he couldn't do anything about it.
Loha wanted to get the contract to make a new hostel for the students of Allahabad University, not because he wanted better facilities for them, but because it would give him an opportunity to earn black money through the funds that were allocated for the purpose. Loha wanted to gang up against the Vice-Chancellor and coerce him to sign the contract, and for that, he needed all the students to show up together. Daddu brings each and every student from the hostel, and together they successfully negotiate the deal.Daddu's love interest, Jhullan , came from a conservative background. Her father had started looking for a probable match for her daughter. He wanted her to get married to a bureaucrat, preferably an IAS officer. She had been pestering Daddu to either crack the exam and become an IAS officer, or elope with her, as her father wouldn't agree to anything less than that. Jhulan always saw through the intentions of Loha and warned Daddu against it. Jhulan was blunt when it came to speaking her heart out, and she did that without any sort of hesitation. She told Daddu that Loha was just fueling his political ambitions through him. Loha had promised Daddu that he would leak the examination paper and help Daddu become an IAS officer. Daddu was banking on that as he knew that otherwise, it wasn't possible for him to crack the exams.Jhullan's father got to know about her affair with Daddu . He lost his temper and decided to immediately leave for Varanasi, where he had found an eligible bachelor, and get Jhulan married straight away. Jhulan was not able to inform Daddu about anything, as he was busy organizing a protest at the Chief Minister's residence. Loha enjoyed the support of the minister, Tripathi, head of the Janshakti party. The minister asked him to stop meddling in petty affairs and look at the bigger picture. He told him that the Mandal Commission bill was going to be passed in parliament. It brought with it an opportunity. An opportunity to stir things up at the ground level and become the biggest student leader of Allahabad University and eventually pave the way for an illustrious political career. Loha knew exactly what he had to do. He tells Daddu that even if he gets the paper, he will not be able to crack IAS as Mandal commission reservation will ensure that an SC/ST or OBC will take the seat with even 45% marks while Daddu could score even 90% and not get a seat. This enrages Daddu and he aligns with Loha's plan to set Allahabad on fire. Loha and Tripathi convince Daddu that being an MLA is better than being an IAS.Loha Singh's plan was very clear. He didn't care about giving the students an equal pedestal, but saw this as an opportunity to make his dream of becoming an MLA a reality. He got the desired support from the students, as together with Daddu, now even Ranjan  was on their side . Ranjan was the ex-roommate of Daddu Thakur, the one who understood and cared for him. Ranjan had made it very clear that he would join the movement only when Daddu would promise to stop all his violent activities and fight on logic rather than irrational agendas. Ranjan supported reservation based on economic status. He wanted to uplift the downtrodden without hurting anybody.
With Ranjan coming on their side, more students joined the protest. Meanwhile, Jhullan's father had kept her under strict watch, and it was impossible for her to reach out for help. Jhullan's brother contacted one of Loha Singh's men and told him to inform Daddu about the ongoing situation. But Loha asked his man to not tell Daddu anything. He feared that if Daddu knew about it, he would leave everything and go after Jhulan.Due to the protests, the Prime Minister had decided to meet a delegation of 50 students and listen to what they had to say. Loha told Daddu that he wanted him to be a part of that delegation from Allahabad. But in reality, Loha had some other plans. He wanted to back-stab Daddu at any given opportunity and instead send his brother, Gopal, to the delegation. Daddu got to know about Jhullan's whereabouts and decided to go and get her back. Jhulan had just gotten married that day itself, but she decided to elope with Daddu.They both came back to Loha's residence, as Daddu felt that was the only safe place he could hide Jhulan. Jhulan said that she didn't want to stay there as she despised Loha and didn't trust his intentions one bit. Loha saw this as an opportunity. Jhulan belonged to a socially backward caste, and he wanted to use it to gain leverage. He asked Gopal to tell minister Tripathi that Daddu could not be a part of a delegation as he himself was getting married to a girl who belonged to a socially backward class. Then Loha came with Daddu and opposed his own brother in front of the minister. Gopal was agitated and didn't understand why he was insulted by Loha, when he had only asked him to do the needful. Loha told him that he wanted Daddu to believe that he was on his side, and then strike him when he least expected it. Loha had told Daddu that he would send him and Jhulan to Agra after one last protest. But secretly, he had devised a plan to kill Daddu during that protest and gain sympathy votes in his favor, and ultimately win the elections. He had given orders to kill Jhulan too, who was supposed to meet Daddu on the highway post protest. The protest started, and Loha's men reached to pick up Jhulan. She saw them making wrong turns and suspected that they were up to something. Loha's men finally stopped the car and decided to shoot Jhulan when she somehow overpowered them and managed to escape the scene.Daddu was busy leading the crowd when Ranjan realized that Gopal was preparing to kill him. He threw a barrel of flammable liquid at Daddu, but Ranjan came in between. In front of Daddu's eyes, Ranjan, his best friend, was put on fire and eventually met his fateful end. Ranjan had always warned Daddu about the association he shared with Loha, but little did he know that he would have to pay the price for it. Daddu was reunited with Jhulan, and that's when he got to know about the real motives of Loha Singh. A guilt-ridden Daddu went to Loha's residence straightaway and killed both Loha and his younger brother Gopal. Daddu woke up in the hospital, he found Jhulan sitting next to him. She told him to not waste the sacrifice made by Ranjan and lead the students in the delegation. Daddu did go to Delhi and stood for everything that Ranjan believed in strongly.","['Drama', 'Romance']","Back in 1990s, an aspiring IAS starts a rebellion against the caste-based reservation.","Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi,Dasvi,Chittagong,Jai Gangaajal,Zila Ghaziabad,Paan Singh Tomar"

11783766,Ram Setu,Action Adventure bridge rock sample report dates finds evidence,Action Adventure legendary heritage atheist archaeologist turned believer race time prove true existence evil forces destroy pillar,"The movie starts with ASI archaeologist Dr Aryan Kulshreshtha , a non-believer, shedding doubt on the commonly held public opinion of the Ram Setu being a man made structure, and with it the historical validity of the Ramayana. He is currently involved in the restoration of the Bamyan Buddha statues in Afghanistan. While on site, he finds a buried treasure that has coins dating back to ancient India 7th century. At that moment, the Taliban attack the site, forcing Aryan to run towards the Buddha statues to take shelter. On the way, he runs into a crevice and slides several hundred feet into a cave that has a reclining Buddha statue.
Eventually Aryan is able to get the treasure extracted to Pakistan. Aryan lives with wife Gayatri & son Kabir  in Delhi.He is subsequently tasked with proving that the Ram Setu is just a natural phenomenon by Indrakant  . Indrakant wants to create a shipping canal by destroying the Ram Setu, but a PIL in the Supreme Court blocks his path. Aryan doesn't believe in God and is hence perfect to undertake this research and provide a conclusive answer.
Aryan submits his report in the court which states that since there is no proof of Ram's existence, thus the Ram Setu structure has to be a natural phenomenon. The court asks him to reconsider  since his report challenges the faith of the entire nation and will disturb cultural harmony. Gayatri is angry with Aryan for challenging the cultural beliefs of the nation.
Indrakant offers to fund Aryan's expedition, so he can write another report backed with evidence, to submit to the Supreme Court. Aryan opts out at first, but sees that his family is being targeted by society for his mistakes. He has only one option, to go on the expedition and reveal the truth.The expedition takes Aryan to Indrakant's ship, the Pushpak Alpha, off the coast of Tamilnadu, next to the Ram Setu. The ship has Dr. Gabrielle  a geologist from Brazil, Dr Chandra specializes in underwater research, an AMS machine for carbon dating, Dr Andrews head of remote sensing and sonar, Udyan and his team of scuba divers, and Dr Sandra. Project Manager Bali  is coordinating everyone on behalf of Indrakant. Aryan also has an Exo-suit at his disposal, which he can use to explore underwater for several hours.
The Ram Setu is 35 Kms long and connects Pambam in Tamilnadu to Mannar Island in Sri Lanka. It goes up to 3.5 Kms in width and 10 m in depth. According to research on star positions described in the Ramayana, the epic is dated around 5114 BC.
Aryan conducts his scientific research . The sediments on the bridge date to 18000 yrs old. But Aryan insists on getting an actual sample of the rock used in the bridge  to find conclusive proof. The rock sample dates back to 5000 BC. Sandra also finds proof that the corals near the bridge were deliberately planted by someone in a straight line and are part of the bridge structure. Aryan is convinced that Ram Setu is man made.To collect more evidence about the existence of Rama . The submersible has Aryan, Sandra and Gabrielle , but it loses power inside Sri-Lankan waters in between a ferocious storm at night. Aryan realizes that Bali sabotaged the submersible and sent them to their deaths. Aryan uses the emergency blow to surface the submersible where they are saved by AP in his boat.Aryan travels to Sri Lanka helped by environmentalist Dr. Sandra Rebello  and a local Lankan guide Anjaneyan Pushpakumaran 'AP' . AP offers to help them get to the main structure of the bridge and obtain a larger, attached sample of rock. The next day, Bali and his men spot Aryan and AP at sea and follow them to their Island. Bali and his men are stopped by the Tamil rebels, who was patrolling in the area. They rescue AP, Aryan, Sandra and Gabrielle. Gabrielle is shot during the escape and dies. The rock she stole from the ship is lost lost in the chaos.
Indrakant wants Bali to finish Aryan and retrieve the stolen rock sample. He wants Chandra to write his report, stating that Ram Setu is a natural formation only. The report is released in Supreme Court and the opposition has 3 days to file a reply. Aryan uses a satellite phone to call Gayatri and says that Indrakant wants to kill him and the report in the Supreme Court is not his.Aryan decides to look for Ramayan evidence in Sri Lanka. AP takes him to the Jaffna public library that has ancient documents and maps on palm leaves. He learns that the library was set on fire in 1981, but a local librarian saved the manuscripts. AP tracks the librarian down and the manuscripts reveal a secret tunnels constructed by Mayasur, who was Ravana's father-in-law who built the Lanka fort. It talks about the location of the Golden Lanka in the shape of a triangle. AP sees that one entrance to the tunnel is from Ashok Vatika. Following clues they travel to Ravana falls, where Ravana was rumored to sit for hours and play his Veena.
Following a crocodile in the water, the trio of AP, Aryan and Sandra find the entrance to the tunnel. Bali has been tracking Aryan, but doesn't know where Aryan will exit the tunnel. So, in consultation with Indrakant they kidnap Professor Gayatri Kulshrestha , Aryan's wife as she knows all of his thinking and can predict his actions.Aryan follows the clues inside the tunnels and finds the Golden Lanka, the Palace of Ravana. They find traces of the Sanjeevani herb.. At that moment Bali attacks in a helicopter with Gayatri as hostage. Bali has the manuscript and wants the lost rock. Aryan insists that the rock was lost. In the ensuing skirmish, AP is killed while Gayatri shoots Bali when he tries to kill Aryan. Aryan finds the floating rock in AP's bag and he saves the manuscript as well. He also saves Bali from dying.
Bali has a change of heart and helps Aryan get to the court just before the judgment on the case is pronounced. Aryan flies to Delhi and presents his evidence to the court.
He also states that in 1788 even the British map maker James Rennel, named the bridge Ram Setu, in his first map of India. But in the 1804 version, he renamed the bridge to Adam's bridge and started a story that the bridge was used by Adam to cross from Silanka to India. This was a British ploy to make Indian history more Eurocentric.Aryan argues that metro route was changed to save Qutab Minar. Taj corridor was stopped to save the Taj Mahal. Hindu monuments need to be saved too. The court decides that the Govt needs to provide proper proof that Ram Setu was not built by Shri Ram and dismisses the case to demolish the bridge.
In AP's bag, Aryan finds a diary with only ""Jai Shri Ram"" written in all pages. AP could also stand for Anjani Putra. AP could have been a descendant of Hanuman himself, who helped Aryan in his quest of Ramayan and Shri Ram.","['Action', 'Adventure']",An atheist archaeologist turned believer must race against time to prove the true existence of the legendary Ram Setu before evil forces destroy the pillar of India's heritage.,"Hate Story IV,The Kashmir Files,Laal Kaptaan,Shivaay,Raid,Nautanki Saala!"

However, Raghunath asks for a large amount of money, which Sadashiv denies, citing the treasury's condition after consecutive battles. Raghunath, therefore, refuses to march north, which leads the Peshwa to appoint Sadashiv as the commander-in-chief of the Maratha army, under the overlordship of Vishwas Rao, the Peshwa's son and heir. The army, along with a large number of non-combatants , begin their long and arduous journey north.

They arrive at Dholpur, where they're welcomed by their fellow Maratha generals— Govind Pant Bundela, Balwant Rao Mehendale, Jankoji Shinde, and the veteran Malhar Rao Holkar. They start making alliances with other kingdoms, including Maharaja Suraj Mal and Nawab Shuja-ud-Daulah, and are successful, with their army size growing to 50,000 men. Abdali is also making alliances, taking advantage of the Rajput kings' hatred for the Marathas. Sadashiv and the commanders receive intelligence that Abdali has camped on the other side of the Yamuna and spot Shuja's flags along with Abdali's, revealing that the Nawab had switched allegiance. Due to the heavy rains, the Marathas are unable to build a bridge to cross the Yamuna. Sadashiv decides to march north and capture Delhi and then cross the Yamuna to defeat Abdali.

Najib receives intelligence that the Marathas have retreated, from which Abdali deduces that they are marching north to Delhi. He suggests that they also march north and cross the Yamuna. Meanwhile, the Marathas defeat Najib's general and capture Delhi. After finding out the Afghans are chasing the Marathas, Sadashiv decides to strategically capture Kunjpura Fort and eventually carry out a massacre there of helpless Afghans departed from their main column, which angers Abdali to such an extent that he immediately reacts by crossing the swollen Yamuna in heavy rainfall. This leaves the Maharaja of Patiala, Ala Singh, unable to send his soldiers. Food begins to dwindle, and the Maratha soldiers and civilians are forced to go without food. Although the arrival of King Aradhak Singh provides some relief to the Maratha camp, but soon after camping at Panipat, Abdali catches up with the Marathas and comes face to face. However, after hearing of a possible coup d'état at his capital in Kandahar, Abdali arranges for a truce with Sadashiv but scraps it after the latter disagrees to Abdali's terms. After both sides decide on strategies and formations, they prepare for the final confrontation.

Parvati Bai and the civilians and pilgrims stay at a small camp towards the back, and Vishwas promises Sadashiv that he'll never get off his elephant during the battle for his own protection. Artillery firing begins by both sides, with substantial damage done to Abdali's army due to Ibrahim Khan's leadership. The riflemen also start attacking. The infantry then begins the main attack, with the Marathas doing well. Overcome with fear, many soldiers of Abdali's army retreat, but Abdali threatens them with severe punishment and forces them to return to the battle. Meanwhile, on seeing Shamsher wounded, Vishwas descends from his elephant to protect him. Sadashiv fends off the Afghans who attacked the young prince, but a bullet hits Vishwas on his head, killing him. This is a huge blow to the morale of the Marathas, who begin to lose ground from then. One by one, the Maratha chieftains are either wounded or killed. Araadhak Singh unexpectedly retreats from the battle. It is then revealed that he was angry with the Marathas for the high taxes imposed upon them, so he secretly allied himself with Abdali and passed the information onto him. Seeing the tide of the battle turn, Malhar Rao retreats from the battlefield and escorts the non-combatants to safety, as promised to Sadashiv on the eve of the battle. Abdali's soldiers close in on Sadashiv but he bravely fights back, sustaining serious injuries. He eventually succumbs to his wounds and dies, but not before making Abdali aware of his pyrrhic victory.

Back in Pune, Parvati Bai dies from grief. Abdali sends the Peshwa a letter, praising Sadashiv's bravery and courage. The epilogue reveals that even though victorious, Abdali never returned to India. Under the leadership of Peshwa Madhav Rao, the generals Mahadaji Shinde and Tukoji Rao Holkar saved the Maratha empire from extinction, and re-captured Delhi ten years later, making the Marathas a dominant force once again.","['Action', 'Drama', 'History', 'War']","The Great Betrayal is a War Epic set in 1761, when Sadashiv Rao Bhau Peshwa led the Maratha army to the north of India to repel the invading forces of Ahmad Shah Abdali, the King of Afghanistan.","Kochadaiiyaan,Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster 3,Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster Returns,Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi,Bajirao Mastani,Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior"
8907974,Looop Lapeta,Action Comedy Crime Romance Thriller brothers cash wedding store father decides arrives cab bus leaves man pregnant,Action Comedy Crime Romance Thriller cash races clock save ends boyfriend loses mobster break curious cycle dead,"Savina ""Savi"" Borkar is a promising track-and-field athlete whose career is ruined by a knee injury. While recovering from surgery at the hospital, she decides to commit suicide, only to be stopped by Satyajeet ""Satya"", a small-time, ne'er-do-well crook. They fall in love and begin a relationship, which her father Atul disapproves of. One day, Satya is tasked by his boss Victor to deliver a package  to an address and collect ₹ 5,000,000 in 80 minutes. Satya delivers the package and collects the cash, but decides to gamble it, so he can return Victor's share and keep the winnings for himself. While on his way to a casino, he gets high with a stranger and loses the bag of cash on a bus. Realizing his life is in danger if he doesn't return Victor's money, Satya calls Savi in a panic. Savi, who has just found out that she's pregnant, decides to ask Atul for the money.

On her way to Atul's gym, Savi interacts with Jacob, a cab driver whose girlfriend Julia is marrying another man. Jacob refuses to drive Savi, so she vandalizes his cab, attracting the attention of policeman David. Savi asks Atul for money, but they get into an argument as Atul was her coach and their relationship soured after Savi's injury. Savi blames Atul for dating a man after her mother's death. The two cannot reconcile and Savi leaves empty-handed. David spots her and gives chase but she evades him by hiding at Julia's wedding. Meanwhile, bumbling brothers Appu and Gappu plan to rob their father Mamlesh's jewelry store. Satya arrives at the store with the same idea, and a Mexican standoff ensues. Savi distracts everyone by throwing a brick through a glass window, allowing Satya to escape with the money. However, the brothers catch up to them in an alley, and Mamlesh arrives and shoots and kills Satya. Over a flashback, Satya relates the story of Savitri, who tricked Yama, the god of death, into sparing her husband Satyavan, despite Satyavan being fated to die. The day then resets to Savi finding out that she's pregnant, essentially granting her a second chance at saving Satya.

As the second iteration begins, Savi takes Satya's call and asks him to stay put and not chase after the bus. As she tries to reach her father's gym, she gets into an altercation with a man, once again attracting the attention of David, who chases her into Jacob's cab and forces Jacob to drive at gunpoint, but they crash into the bus containing the cash. Savi, relatively unharmed, steals David's gun and holds Atul at gunpoint, but he doesn't have any money. As she leaves the gym, David chases her into Julia's wedding, and she hides in Julia's dressing room. There, Julia rants about the difficult situation she finds herself in, since she wants to marry Jacob. However, Savi advises her to leave Jacob and go through with the wedding, which Jacob overhears as he has climbed up the balcony. As Julia takes the advice and kisses her husband-to-be Robert, a shocked Jacob falls off the balcony and severely injures himself. As Satya wanders near the jewelry store, he gets into an argument with the brothers and they take his gun. When Savi arrives, she tells Satya that they will rob the brothers once the brothers have robbed the shop. This plan works, but Jacob arrives and kills Satya as revenge for Savi ruining his life. The day resets again.

Once the third iteration sets into motion, Savi decides to right her wrongs in order to manipulate events to save Satya. She apologizes to her father and the two reconcile, each agreeing to make an effort to get along with the other's boyfriend. She gets into Jacob's cab and convinces him that he must fight for Julia if he truly loves her. They drive to the wedding, where Savi helps Jacob and Julia elope. She steals a bag containing cash gifts for the wedding, then gambles that money and wins big, gaining enough cash to pay Victor back. Meanwhile, the brothers create a fake kidnapping situation so they can extract ransom money from their father. When Satya goes to rob the store, Mamlesh recognizes him as a former customer and hatches a plan with him to fake a robbery to collect insurance money. When the brothers arrive to act out the kidnapping, Mamlesh turns on Satya, only to realize that Satya had emptied his gun. As Satya leaves the store with the money, David and the police are responding to the hostage situation, but mistake him for a civilian and let him go. Satya meets with Savi and she reveals she is pregnant; they decide to get married. They deliver Victor's cash, and still have Savi's winnings left over. As the film ends, Satya notices the stranger on the bus who took his bag and begins chasing after him.","['Action', 'Comedy', 'Crime', 'Romance', 'Thriller']","When her boyfriend loses a mobster's cash, Savi races against the clock to save the day if only she can break out of a curious cycle of dead ends.","Satya 2,Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster Returns,Satyameva Jayate 2,Satyaprem Ki Katha,Talaash,Bloody Daddy"

Tara's mom went to talk to Adi's family about getting married, which made Tara very mad. Then, Adi found out his video game got picked for a big competition in Los Angeles, so he has to go there soon. He told Jenny that it would be tough for him to see Tara. Tara also looked upset. The next day, Adi and Tara promised to have lots of fun together for the next ten days, but then they would have to go their own ways.

The four people, who have never met before, are:Neil Menon , a casino owner in Turkey. He has financial problems with mob bosses that Kabir offers to help with.
Vikram Kapoor , an actor in India, who suffers with drug and career problems. Kabir writes to him that he wants to finance the biggest film ever made, and offers Vikram a role in it.
Om Prakash ""OP"" Ramsay , a political leader and ministerial candidate in Thailand. His campaign is under threat of scandal, and Kabir offers to provide new funding to him.
Tisha Khanna , a crime journalist in the United Kingdom who is looking for her big break. Kabir writes to her, saying that he has a huge story and invites her to cover it.The four guests arrive on the island, where they are greeted by Kabir's personal assistant, Samara Shroff , who takes them into a dining room that is being secretly filmed. There, Kabir reveals that he has invited them because of their link to his daughter, Maya , whom Kabir has spent years trying to find. Maya was trafficked as a child by OP Ramsay in Thailand , as an adult brought into the crime world by Neil Menon , and in the end, hit by a car in a car accident and buried alive by Vikram Kapoor. Maya was Kabir's child with Mallika whom he met 26 yrs ago, but never married. 3 yrs ago Mallika had contacted Kabir's sister and told her about the existence of twin girls.
Kabir has gathered evidence against the three of them and invited the International Vigilance Squad  to the island to arrest them. Tisha Khanna, the only innocent one of the group, was invited because, previously unknown to her, she is Maya's fraternal twin sister and Kabir's only remaining biological child. Tisha rejects Kabir's attempts to forge a relationship with her, claiming that she doesn't want his fortune.
Neil remembers how he and Maya escaped an assassination attempt together and bonded after that.Unable to escape the island, the group await the arrival of the IVS. Samara was with Neil. In the morning, they hear what sounds like a gunshot from Kabir's room. They find Kabir Malhotra dead in his study, seemingly having committed suicide with a gun. A document was found burning, which was the will in which Kabir had transferred all his property to Tisha.
The IVS, led by Sia Agnihotri , arrive on the island. They bag the evidence and also find that Kabir had last stages of pancreatic cancer and was anyways dying. She watches the video of the previous night's speech by Kabir, but as they are unable to find the evidence that Kabir claimed to have, they let the guests go. Although the case is officially declared a suicide, Sia is not convinced and puts all four guests under surveillance.Through flashback, it is revealed that Neil was in love with Maya, who saved his life during a shootout at his casino. And also that on the day of her death, she told Neil, through a voice mail that she was pregnant with their child. In the present day, Neil evades Sia's surveillance, and takes revenge on OP Ramsay and Vikram for what they did to Maya. Both are tricked into giving public confessions of their crimes, which Neil records and then shows them on live news globally. Vikram commits suicide, and OP Ramsay dies of a heart attack . Sia, who has been monitoring Vikram and OP Ramsay, knows that Neil is responsible.
It is revealed that Neil is also an officer of the IVS. His real name is Major Arjun Singhania, and he has been in deep cover for many years in the Turkish drug cartel. He, too, doesn't believe that Kabir committed suicide, and works together with Sia to find the true culprit. Neil noticed that Kabir was left-handed, yet the gun that killed him was in his right hand.Tisha, as Kabir Malhotra's only child, is to inherit Kabir's fortune, but Neil and Sia receive news that Tisha attempted suicide. When Tisha wakes up, she tells them that it wasn't suicide, but someone attacked her in her house. Meanwhile, it is found that Kabir has a brother, Iqbal, who is next in line to inherit his fortune. Sia and Neil travel to the missionary where Iqbal lives, but they find him too ill to speak to them. A nurse tells them that Iqbal had a daughter who died, but Neil notices that there are letters sent to him dated after her supposed to death, so she must still be alive.Neil and Sia travel back to the island, where they confront the late Kabir's personal assistant, Samara. It is revealed that Samara is actually Natasha, Iqbal's daughter and Kabir's biological niece, though Kabir never knew. Neil realized that there was foul play when, at the missionary, he saw a picture of Kabir and Iqbal when they were children, and they were identical twins, so the man in the missionary couldn't have been Kabir's brother. Iqbal  reveals himself, explaining that he's been working with Natasha to get Kabir's fortune. Tisha was a surprise they hadn't anticipated, so they had to take her out of the picture. They used Kabir's three guilty guests to deflect suspicion from Samara, predicting correctly that the police would suspect one of the guests as responsible for Kabir's murder.
Natasha had shot Kabir slightly earlier in the day and then used a firecracker on a delayed timer to create a gunshot noise, while she was with Neil. The same firecracker set fire to the will in which Kabir had given everything to Tisha.Iqbal attempts to kill Neil and Sia, but Neil resists, which results in Iqbal being killed and Natasha arrested.","['Action', 'Crime', 'Drama', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']","A wealthy man invites four people to his private island to blame three of them for his daughter's sudden death.

She shares a bitter relationship with her dad who is always blaming her for her mistakes in the past, instead of giving her moral support; so now, Praful wants to move out and buy her own house.

She has applied for a loan and her loan gets pre-approved. In the meantime, Praful decides to go with her cousin on a trip to Las Vegas .

In Las Vegas, she plays baccarat for the first time and wins big in her first few rounds. She quickly gets addicted to the game. The next day, she returns to the casino but ends up losing not only the money she won the previous day but a large chunk of her savings also.

Praful then returns to Atlanta after a week, only to find out that her bank application to the bank has been rejected as her credit rating is very low. Praful seeks her father's help but he insists that she should meet a young man named Sameer  who has been selected as her suitor.

After meeting with the suitor, she has mixed feelings about marriage and agrees to get engaged. However, her addiction to gambling takes a toll on her and Praful gives her last shot to gambling and goes back to Vegas.

Unfortunately, she ultimately loses all her savings so a private money lender spots Praful  in the casino and offers her money. The drunk Praful – not in her right senses- takes $32,000 from the moneylender and in exchange gives him her driving license.

Praful loses all that borrowed money  and has to return penniless to her home.

Praful tries to explain to her father her bad situation and needing his financial help, but in fear of retaliation and hostility, she is reluctant. Her parents want her to begin her wedding preparations and plans with Sameer, who by now gets impressed by her personality.

At a relative's wedding, Praful and Sameer meet again and dance, and get to know each other. However, Praful is threatened by the loan sharks to pay within 10 days or face death, so she is disturbed and anxious, unable to concentrate on her wedding plans.

Therefore, Praful develops the habit of stealing whereby first she disguises herself  and approaches a cashier at a gas station shop. She collects only $10,000 so she has to go and rob a bank , with a disguise, and hands a note written with red lipstick that says money should be given to her otherwise she will blow the whole bank as she is strapped to a bomb.

Praful's second robbery gets foiled by a bank manager who bumps into her when she tries to rob the bank similarly. When the manager asks her name, Praful tells her name 'Simran', the name of a popular character from an Indian blockbuster film Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge which her mother ultimately watches often.

Although Praful's plan to rob the bank gets foiled, she manages to escape and similarly robs another bank.

Praful Patel has now become a most wanted criminal with the name 'Simran – The Lipstick Bandit'. Despite robbing 3 to 4 banks successfully, Praful is still short of collecting fifty thousand dollars.

Meanwhile, Praful develops a liking towards Sameer, and confides in him her bad habits of gambling and stealing which he does not take seriously, thinking it is some kind of a joke. Trouble comes back when loan sharks attack Praful in her hotel for the money and Praful's ex-boyfriend Mike – the general manager of the hotel steals the money from her locker room and refuses to give the money back to her until and unless she submits to his sexual advances/desires.

Praful ultimately hits him and gets suspended from the hotel, after which she tells the loan sharks that her money has been stolen. By now, these loan sharks know that Praful is actually 'Simran – The Lipstick Bandit', so they ask her to rob one more bank and this time with a bigger amount—for which they offer her a gun to finish the job.

Devastated and dejected, Praful calls off her relationship with Sameer and asks him to leave and by telling him the truth. Enraged by this, Praful's father slaps her and asks her to leave his house.

Praful leaves her home and stays with her best friend Salma  for a night. The next day Praful attacks the same bank that rejected her bank loan and flees the place after stealing the money.

Sameer is still in love with Praful and to help her, he transfers a huge amount of fifty thousand dollars in her bank account.

Praful, before leaving the city of Atlanta, calls him at a lonely place and tells him that he should find another girl, as he is a nice man and he deserves someone better; not someone like her.

Sameer refuses and asks her to surrender to the police and end this dirty game once and for all; after which Praful's dad calls her and asks for forgiveness. Praful is happy at this and returns home but the police cars have surrounded her and are following her car to arrest her.

Praful drives off because she did not want to get arrested in her neighbourhood, which is full of Indians, and her parents would be very ashamed of her there. The ultimate chase begins as Praful's car is found empty by the police. Praful had taken a taxi and was almost near the airport, but then she decides to surrender on a lonely highway. She asks the taxi to stop at the curbside and then she calls 9–1–1 and surrenders herself.

After her arrest, there is a trial whereby the judge adjudicates Praful to be imprisoned for 10 months, but she is released after 3–4 months due to good behaviour. Her ex-boyfriend Mike is also imprisoned for stealing her money and also for his sexual advance.

During a meeting session in prison, Praful tells her father that she wants to invest all his money into the stock market. Enraged by this, Praful's father becomes angry and grabs her neck angrily, venting his frustration that all his hard-earned money will blow up in smoke due to her crazy intentions.

The film ends with titles suggesting that Praful has been released from jail and she has sold the rights of her movie to be made to a Bollywood producer for fifty thousand dollars.","['Crime', 'Drama', 'Thriller']","A socially-criticized, financially-cornered girl becomes an outlaw to dodge the situation.","Chopsticks,Velle,Kick,Daawat-e-Ishq,Ankahi Kahaniya,Hum Do Hamare Do"

Faraaz knew that he could have an opulent lifestyle in the United States of America, yet he felt that it was his duty and responsibility to work for the betterment of his own people.Nibras Islam , Rohan Imtiaz , Meer Saameh Mobashir , Bikash , and Khairul Islam , members of a terrorist outfit, had taken Holey Artisan Cafe, in Gulshan, Dhaka, under their control, and according to them, by doing so, they were reviving jihad in Bangladesh.
One chef manages to escape the initial purge and runs out.
Rajiv  is their handler. Nibras and his team kill all foreigners and non Muslims, but vow not to harm any Bangladeshi Muslims. Rajiv has a day job as a simple call center executive.Faraaz Hussain was also trapped inside with two of his friends, Ayesha  and Tarika . Nibras knew Faraaz from before when they played football together, which is why he gave him the option of leaving the premises, though he was not allowed to take his friends with him. The girls were in an attire that Nibras considers Unislamic and refuses to let them leave.
Eventually the police respond to the news of gunfire from the Bakery. The terrorists open fire at the cops. The cops call for reinforcements. Deputy Commissioner Mushtaq  & boss  take tactical control of the situation.
The commissioner leads an assault team right from the front of the cafe. A gunfight erupts and the police take heavy casualties. Nibras turns off the lights inside the cafe and lines up the hostages against the windows.Sudhir  is Tarika's father and meets Simeen just next to the barricades as they try to get some news of what is going on inside the cafe.
SWAT team arrives and is led by RAB Officer Benazir . Benazir admonishes the commissioner for his stupidity in leading a front on assault on the cafe in which 12 officers lost their lives. Benazir assigns his officer Manirul Islam  to lead operations from there on.
Benazir also plans an assault, but the PM calls and asks the commissioner to negotiate with the terrorists.The terrorists believed themselves to be messengers of God who had been sent to purify the land and teach people what it meant to be a true Muslim. They believed that if they accomplished their mission, they would be welcomed in paradise and have an afterlife that had all the pleasures of the world. Had the terrorists been uneducated, Faraaz would have still understood why they had such flawed ideologies, but when people like Nibras, who were well qualified, behaved in such a foolish manner, he didn't know what to tell them or how to make them see the reality.Benazir asks the officers to cut off the internet when Nibras circulates photos of the carnage inside the cage via Rajiv. He also asks the IT team to hack into the CCTV inside the cafe. Nibras uses the cafe WiFi and broadband network to continue communicating with Rajiv.
Faraaz just couldn't take what Nibras was blabbering about Islam, and he couldn't stop his urge to tell the guy that he was not only an ignorant person but also a puppet in the hands of the people who were least bothered to maintain the sanctity of their religion and just wanted to use him as a pawn. Nibras told Faraaz that he knew everything about Islam and that he was trying to protect his religion from non-believers. Faraaz knew that anything he said against the terrorists could lead to his death, but he just couldn't stop himself. He told Nibras that his interpretation of the Quran was totally flawed and sarcastically commented that if he had actually read the holy book instead of listening to the twisted interpretation of his leaders, he would have had a better understanding of what the Prophet wanted.Nibras said that he didn't have any option other than to pick up arms since his people were being oppressed and killed by the first-world nations. Nibras was proud of the fact that, because of them, Bangladesh had opened a new front in the war, and the world had come to know that the Bangladeshi Muslims were ready to sacrifice their lives for the sake of their religion. Faraaz tried to make him understand that this was not how he would get to a solution and that this vicious cycle would keep repeating itself again and again.
Faraaz made a very interesting point when he said that people misunderstand the fact that their identity came from their religion, when in reality, it came from their culture. He pointed out that a couple of boys in his group also had Hindu names, and that didn't mean that they were any lesser Muslims; it just showed the kind of culture they came from. Faraaz told Nibras that he was merely a bully with a gun whose intentions were not as worthy as he thought them to be.In the morning, after the morning prayers, Nibras releases all the hostages voluntarily. Faraaz, along with Ayesha and Tarika, were shot dead by Nibras and his men as Ayesha was a Hindu. Nibras gave Faraaz the option to leave the premises, but he decided to stand by his friends and not compromise on his principles.
The RAB and SWAT move in and gun the terrorists down.The target of the terrorists were non-Muslims, and if they had any doubt about a person's religion, they made them recite ""Surahs and Ayats."" 22 hostages were killed by the terrorists, most of whom were foreign nationals. The terrorists made sure that the Muslims got food and water, while they did not provide any such things to the other people.The terrorists made sure that they treated all the Bangladeshis with the utmost dignity and respect, and they also tried to tell them the motive behind conducting such an attack. The hostages who were released told the authorities that the terrorists said that they didn't want their own people following the Western lifestyle because they considered it sinful. The government of Bangladesh launched ""Operation Thunderbolt,"" and that's when the Rapid Action Battalion  and Special Weapons and Tactics Division  took matters into their own hands. The forces took the entire area under control in less than 50 minutes, and all five terrorists who were inside were killed in the exchange of fire.The terrorists had obscurantist ideologies, and they wanted the entire country to think, and act like them. There was actually a person named Faraaz Hossain, stuck inside the Artisan Cafe during the 2016 attack, who refused to come out and decided to stay with his friends. Faraaz was awarded the Mother Teresa International Memorial Award posthumously in 2016 for taking a stand against violence and showing the world that there was still some humanity left. Faraaz showed people how wrong they were in stereotyping the entire Muslim community, as not all people following Islam were terrorists.","['Action', 'Thriller']","Based on the real-life terrorist attack that ravaged a Dhaka cafe, Faraaz is a tense hostage drama that unfolds over one claustrophobic night.","My Name Is Khan,Shirin Farhad Ki Toh Nikal Padi,Bellbottom,Mulk,Afwaah,Thugs of Hindostan"

15715122,Dybbuk: The Curse Is Real,Drama Horror Ezr box spirit Nur rkus finds ntique notices sks bbi shop rts sleep,Drama Horror woman brings antique home box newly married husband begin experiences spirit mystery paranormal learn dybbuk evil born couple,"Following the death of Moshe bin Asher, one of Mauritius’ last Jews, an antique dealer purchases an old box that belonged to Asher. The same night, before leaving, he instructs his assistant to pack some stuff and lock the shop. While doing his task, his attendant unlocks the box and is killed by the spirit inside.

A police officer, Riaz, is on the case to solve the mystery behind the worker’s death but is not able to track down any clues just yet. Even though he notices the box near the body, he doesn’t pay much heed to it.

Sam and Mahi are a couple who relocate from Mumbai to Mauritius. Sam is a part of a company that deals with nuclear waste disposal. After relocating, whilst Sam is busy with his official work, Mahi visits an antique shop and purchases an old box, intended to be used as home décor.

When she comes home and opens the box, she notices strange things inside, which include a glass bottle, a piece of cloth, and a few strands of hair. The box has a hole that is blocked by a wood piece, and as she opens it, an evil spirit comes out and possesses her.

Mahi starts feeling as if there’s someone around her and even sees someone in the bathroom. Scared, she goes to Sam’s office, which is a high radiation area, where no one is allowed. Sam is a bit taken aback when he sees her there.

Mahi explains how she saw someone, but he doesn’t believe her. He blames it on her lack of sleep, which might’ve caused her to hallucinate. However, a few days later, Sam starts noticing that her behavior has changed.

She has constant dark circles under her eyes even though her sleep is deep. Even if he tries to wake her up, she doesn’t move an inch. She also spends most of the time near the antique box.

The same night, he notices that their blankets are taken away while they sleep. He hears a few voices and footsteps and goes to investigate. Not finding anything, he calls his friend, Riaz, and asks him to see if there was some forced entry, but nothing is found.

Regardless, Mahi’s constant weird behavior forces Sam to call his adoptive father, Father Gabriel, who, as soon as he enters the house, knows that there is some evil spirit in the house. He notices the antique box and knows right away that this Dybbuk box is causing all the trouble.

He asks his language expert friend to translate the Jewish words written on the box and finds the name of Abraham Ezra. He advises Sam to go to a rabbi that he knows, and find the solution. The rabbi explains that the Dybbuk can possess only those who are experiencing a mental trauma, or whose mental and physical forces aren’t aligned.

While talking, Markus  enters the scene and listens intently. Sam gets a call from Mahi, informing him that she’s pregnant. The rabbi instantly tells him that it is most likely that the spirit has possessed the fetus and not Mahi.

If exorcism is tried on the spirit, and the spirit realizes it, he can harm everyone. He asks Sam to visit him the next day to discuss possible solutions. However, Sam discovers that he died. Markus gives him a ray of hope and asks him to get ready for the exorcism process.

The most important thing to prepare for the process is to know the gender of the baby, for which they have to wait for a few months. Meanwhile, Markus takes expert opinions and maps out a plan.

One day, while walking on the beach, the neighbor’s dog starts barking at Mahi, which the ‘spirit’ doesn’t like. That night, Sam notices that Mahi is missing from the house. He goes out and finds her roaming the streets with a white bag covered in blood, as well as his office I.D. card.

At a turn, Mahi stops as Markus comes in front of her. He asks her name and why she is here in Jewish, to which she replies Ezra. He keeps his hand on her head, and she faints. The white bag falls to the ground and the head of the neighbor’s dog is seen rolling out.

Markus sets out to find the history of the box. He visits the antique shop where the box was bought from. The owner gives him the address of the Jewish place where the box came from. The place was abandoned and the guard tries to stop him, but he bribes him.

While he’s looking for clues, Ezra’s spirit arrives and kills the guard. The spirit tries to attack Markus, but he takes out his holy locket, after which the spirit leaves. He finally finds a book that explains the entire history of Ezra.

The story goes back to the 1960s, where a Jewish boy named Ezra is in love with a Catholic girl, Nura. His father was a famous businessman in that area. When his father comes to know about the affair, he traps his son at a place where no one is allowed to visit.

Nura comes to know that she’s pregnant, and keeps waiting for Ezra to show up. Ezra writes to her that she should forget him as his father wouldn’t approve of their alliance. Meanwhile, the people of the island, and later Ezra, come to know of her pregnancy.

Disheartened, Nura commits suicide, wearing a wedding dress given by Ezra. The people are angry, and Nura’s father finds Ezra’s letter and connects the dots. He, along with others, finds him and beats him up.

The doctors inform Ezra’s father that he wouldn’t be able to walk or talk anymore. He decides to use black magic to preserve Ezra’s spirit in a Dybbuk, with the curse that whenever it is opened, the spirit will have enough power to kill all the Catholic people of the island.

Another thing that is written in the diary is that in order to carry out this ritual, his body was not cremated or buried, but instead, thrown in the river. A wooden statue was buried instead.","['Drama', 'Horror']","Mahi, a newly married woman, brings an antique Jewish box into her home.

Mahi is dissatisfied despite the film being a success, and in a desperate attempt to prove her acting skills, works in a low-budget art film for months. Angad proposes to her but she feels that they should concentrate on their careers. This causes their relationship to end. The art film never completes, and Mahi goes into depression again.

They got to know each other through an exchange of letters and slowly fall in love. One day, Jaidev receives a letter informing him that Smriti had died by an accident. Now his sister Karuna is the only support system that keeps him motivated. One day Jaidev finds an unconscious girl near a lake and brings her home. After gaining consciousness, she is unable to remember anything from her past life except Jaidev's poems. Karuna becomes skeptical of her presence in the house and gets even more so when the keeper of the cemetery warns them of an evil spirit inside her.

Jaidev is insistent on keeping her at home since he feels a connection with her. He names her Sangeeta. Sangeeta feels frightening phenomena, vomiting iron nails and seeing ghosts in her room. On their way to see a doctor, Sangeeta gets completely possessed by the ghost. To save her, the only person Jaidev can turn to is the cemetery keeper. Slowly Jaidev gets to know that Sangeeta is actually his lost love Smriti. He goes to Smriti's old address to find out the truth. He discovers that Karuna had come there before, asking about Smriti. Jaidev returns home and finds Karuna's body hanging in the forest with suicide notes around it. From Karuna's letters, he learns that his best friend Amar, who envied Jaidev's success, exploited Karuna to obtain revenge on him. When Amar discovered that Jaidev loved Smriti, he went to Smriti, posing as Jaidev, and took her to his residence in Shimla to exploit her, but in the process, Amar was killed. It is his spirit that is now possessing Smriti.

The cemetery keeper warns Jaidev that the spirit is very vengeful and has to be deceitfully taken to the same place it all happened — Amar's residence in Shimla. Once Smriti touches Amar's corpse, Amar's spirit will have to leave Smriti's body and return to his own body; the corpse can be set on fire then, releasing Amar's spirit from the karmic cycle of life and death. Whilst doing this, Smriti must not know where she is being taken, else the spirit will also know. So Smriti is made unconscious and completely enveloped in a sacred cloth. They reach the designated place, but the cemetery keeper trips and the sacred cloth moves away from Smriti's face, awakening the spirit. The possessed Smriti kills all but Jaidev.

Jaidev is badly injured in the battle against the spirit. The spirit in Smriti's body burns Amar's corpse, thus forever remaining in her body. Jaidev helplessly pleads with the spirit to kill him, since there is no meaning in letting him live if the spirit will take Smriti from him. Amar's spirit refuses, saying that this is exactly what he wanted: for Jaidev to suffer. Jaidev cuts a rope attached to a loft in ceiling; a corpse falls from there, landing on Smriti, and making contact with her touch. It is revealed in a flashback that Jaidev and the group had hidden the real corpse of Amar in the ceiling as precaution. The corpse comes alive as Amar is forced to return to his original body. Enraged, Amar's corpse tries to kill Smriti, but Jaidev saves her and sets Amar's corpse on fire, thus releasing Amar's spirit from the karmic cycle of life and death. Jaidev and Smriti reunite, get married and the film ends as they consummate their marriage.","['Drama', 'Horror', 'Romance']","A famous poet, Jaidev, meets a woman who has lost her memories.

2137241,Rock On 2,Drama Music called named music band Sarod back people story dad song place start friends friend,Drama Music band reunites members,"Joe, also known as Joseph Mascarenhas, is a judge on a popular TV show where people compete. He is also a partner at a place called Club Bar & Blues. He knows a person named Kedar Zaveri, who is a member of a band called Magik. Kedar is really good at playing the drums and people call him KD or the Killer Drummer.

KD is telling a story about what happened 5 years ago. Aditya Shroff, who is the main singer of the band called Magik, had to leave the city because something really hurt his feelings.

Jiah Sharma's dad, Pandit Vibhuti Sharma, used to be a really famous musician who played a special instrument called the Sarod. One day, a guy named Uday Mishra comes to Jiah's dad and asks him to teach him music and how to play the Sarod. Jiah's dad is not really sure about it because playing the Sarod reminds him of his son who passed away.

Jiah helps encourage Uday, and they work together to achieve things they both want. Uday plays a special song on his instrument that Jiah had previously recorded. Even though Uday didn't want it, Jiah records his song on a CD and brings it to a music studio. The CD ends up causing a big change of events and brings the members of a band called Magik back together.

On Adi's birthday, his friends Joe and KD come over with their families. They find some poems that Adi wrote in his diary and ask if he has a new song they can play. The next day, the friends start arguing about something from the past. It turns out that Adi is really sad because his music company in Mumbai failed and it caused a young artist to die.

The people in the band all start pointing fingers at each other for things that made the label fail. But then they stop arguing because they don't want to ruin the birthday party. Adi says goodbye to his friend and KD promises to come back soon.

In the movie, we see a part where Magik's story goes back to when Adi remembers a boy named Rahul who wanted him to listen to his music, but Adi said no. Sadly, Rahul felt so sad that he ended his own life. Later, Adi's businesses all burned down, so he went to a place called Cherrapunji. There, he met a girl named Jiah. His friend KD found him there and told him to come back to Mumbai and start over, but Adi didn't want to.

In the story, there are two characters named Uday and Jiah. They are asked to go to a special place called a studio by a person named Joe. When they get there, Jiah meets someone named Adi and sings her song live. The people who work at the studio really like her singing and think she should perform at a big show. But Jiah decides not to do it because she remembers how her dad doesn't like the kind of music she sings. He thinks it ruins the beauty and meaning of music.

Adi and his friends get scared and run away when the band members start fighting. Uday tells them that Rahul is Jiah's brother, which surprises them. It's a very tense situation, and Joe doesn't want to help Adi and KD say sorry to Jiah. Then, the story goes back in time five years when Rahul tried to hurt Adi. This made Rahul angry, and he threatened them. Later on, Adi and KD listen to Rahul's CD and try to call him, but sadly he had already killed himself.

Jiah finds out something that makes her stop talking to Magik and Uday. She remembers how Baba scolded Rahul for ruining Indian music even though Rahul tried to explain and had good reasons.

Adi finds out about some issues in the town where he used to live in Meghalaya. This makes his wife unhappy because she feels like he doesn't spend enough time with her.

Finally, after thinking a lot, Jiah goes to visit Adi in the village and tells him that he should stop feeling sad about Rahul's death. She explains that Rahul was very unhappy with his own life and it affected Adi's life too. Adi then goes to the camp, but there isn't enough money. So, Joe and KD come up with an idea to have a big concert with famous bands to raise money. But when Mahender, who had argued with Adi before, finds out about the concert, he tries to ruin it by sending people to cause trouble.

On that day, a news reporter called Sharma and told him something surprising. He found out that his father, Jiah, was at the place where something bad happened. Jiah got angry and started arguing with Baba. Jiah said that it was his fault that Rahul got hurt because he didn't encourage him when he really needed it. This made Baba think differently about how he should support musicians and artists.

In the story, there is a person named Joe who has a TV show with people competing against each other. One of the contestants brings some new equipment to fix something that was broken. This makes a concert very successful because a girl named Adi helps her friend Jiah feel better and not be scared anymore. The village where they live gets better because someone has to give them money, and a band called Magik gets back together and has a new person join them. Jiah becomes a famous singer.

The three of them constantly cheat on their wives with not one or two but many women. However, while Yogi is the only unsuccessful one due to Maya having a secret friend spying on him, Raj and Vikram can get away with their flirtatious behaviour by fooling their wives and keeping them under check.

One day, when the three wives, who are also friends, meet up, and Maya brings up Sanjana's issue about a free necklace due to Raj when the two met previously that day in a mall, she and Shivani insist on Sanjana having a detective, Kishan Khurana, in reality Maya's ""friend"", solve the problem. However, when Maya arranges a meeting between them, things don't seem to work out because Sanjana happens to rubbish away Kishan's accusations against Raj. This compels Kishan to try exposing Raj by calling all his girlfriends to the New Year's Eve party, but Kishan's plan goes haywire when Vikram steps in and saves Raj.

Confused to the next day, Raj and Vikram suspect a spy being part of the scandal that was about to occur last night and seek help from friend and Canadian Security Intelligence Service agent KD, who instead suggests hiring a private detective as the matter is too trivial and unprofessional for an intelligence agency to handle. However, as fate would have it, they land up at Kishan's place, and, having recognized him from the party, enlist his help. Kishan, who is apparently crushing on Sanjana, decides to engage Raj and Vikram in a double game, which results in the duo mistakenly assuming Yogi as the informer after Kishan shows them a doctored video of Yogi conversing with Sanjana, and ceasing their friendship with him by exposing him on one of his cheat dates. Later that day, he creates a fracas for Raj by nearly exposing him as a cheater when he is caught in a bathing robe. Still, Vikram again comes up with an idea, this time about having Raj pose as an undercover cop in the CSIS, who was unintentionally exposed during a ""mission"" for KD, who played his boss, and was responsible for killing dreaded don King's brother. Sanjana believes the story and forgives Raj, later snubbing Kishan over the exposé.

Realizing that something is wrong with the deal, Kishan learns from Yogi about the plan and decides to expose them by staging himself as King and having them assemble blindfolded, with Sanjana and Shivani in attendance. When the truth is out, Sanjana tries to commit suicide, but Kishan convinces her otherwise, and comes up with a plan to reform Raj and bring his loving former self back to her life, part of which is a plan to entice Raj into jealousy by having Yogi inform him and Vikram of Sanjana beginning an affair and relationship with a dynamic, handsome man, who would be none other than Kishan himself.

Eventually, Kishan's plan of the jealousy game works out well, but trouble brews big time when Shivani, through Kishen's help, has Vikram thrown out of the house upon having obtained ownership of all his property by getting him to unsuspectingly sign ""bank account"" papers during the time he was advising a troubled Raj, who made a witness. Helpless and destroyed, the three men turn to Kishan for help again, where they request him to blow the covers of their enemies, and vow to batter their fugitives to death, little knowing that they instead have a common enemy in Kishan, who throws a subtle suggestion about the same which they fail to recognize. While Sanjana is to keep a fast for Raj, Kishan comes up with his own plan and lures the trio to King's house after they end up with his jacket. Kishen then arranges for the trio to meet King's wife Maddy, who too is doubting King's possible affair, but the meeting turns out a disaster when they learn that King is innocent and Maddy starts shooting at King left, right and center for flirting with another girl.

While waiting for him at his office to discuss details of the meeting, Raj and Vikram, along with Yogi, finally figure out in a sudden fit of musical epiphany that Kishan was in on the scam, double-crossing the three men while playing for their wives, posing as Sanjana's boyfriend, Shivani's ""brother"", and Maya's ""friend"", having lured them to King's lair out of intent. Sanjana disrupts a fight about to break between the four after Kishen arrives to find himself exposed. Assuming her to be openly in league and love with Kishan, Raj demands a divorce from Sanjana, and a shocked Kishan, in the next few days, manages to convince a crying Sanjana for marriage. However, while trying to invite the trio, Kishan is mistaken as the groom-to-be, and they, drunk, are arrested for smashing a police officer's head.

While in the cell, Raj rues about Sanjana and contemplates deceiving her, when he, Vikram and Yogi are bailed out by an injured King. Raj is in fury and decides to kill Kishan, for which King has his henchman Benny give him a gun. Raj succeeds, but when Sanjana confronts him, it turns out that the assembly of people was for the couple's remarriage. However, Kishan reveals himself to be alive, giving the wives relief, with King and Maddy showing up, as Kishan had arranged for their bail. Seeing his dedication, the wives, and Sanjana's mother and sister, ask Kishan about his reason for helping Sanjana way too personally, something which is unexpected of a professional of his kind. Kishan then reveals that his wife Divya once walked in on him cheating on her and killed herself by slitting her wrist. Feeling guilty and breaking down, he set off on a mission to help aggrieved ladies of his wife's kind in order to redeem himself. However, it was with Sanjana that he saw a reflection of his wife in her, and decided to help her.

14042066,Dobaaraa,Drama Fantasy Mystery Thriller told house hospital reality video television boy police back era,Drama Fantasy Mystery Thriller boy happened present woman opportunity save life witnessed death thunderstorm connected television set similar storm,"The film starts in Pune in 1996 and we see a boy named Anay cycling around the town of Hinjewadi. There he lived with his mother, who was making a construction plan for a hospital named ‘Bluecross’. There was a massive storm outside. Anay had a video camera and some tapes with his father’s recordings, whom he missed occasionally. He played one of the old clips later that night, and suddenly he heard some noise from his neighbor, Raja Ghosh’s house. He tried to wake up his mother but failed, and then he went to Raja Ghosh’s house on his own. He found a dead body there on the floor, and while escaping, he was run over by a fire brigade. The time of his death was 2:12 am.
Twenty-five years later, on the same stormy day, Antara Awasthi, a nurse at the ‘Bluecross’ hospital that Anay’s mother was designing, moved into the same house where Anay lived with his mother. Antara’s daughter found an old television with a video camera. They started going through the tapes and found out that the boy in the video recorded some of the clips in the same room where they were watching the television. Later that night, Antara invited their new neighbors, Abhishek and his aunt, Sheela, to dinner. Vikash, Antara’s husband, told him about the video clips and the television. Abhishek told them that the boy they saw on TV was Anay, who had died from an accident. He also told them about the murder of Raja Ghosh’s house. Vikash learned more about Anay’s death and how Raja Ghosh was captured on the internet.
Later that night, Antara felt like going through the tapes again, and something unique happened. She could interact with Anay through the television and the camera. She told him who she was and where she was working. After hearing the hospital’s name, ‘Bluecross’, Anay realized she was from the future as the hospital had not been built in 1996. When Anay heard the noise from Raja Ghosh’s house, Antara warned him not to go there. She told him that  if he went there, he would die. She even showed him the news article where it said that Anay was dead. Anay did not believe it until he ran out of the house and saw a fire brigade crossing the street. The time was 2:12 am, and he escaped his death. The following day, when Antara woke up, she was in a completely different state. She did not have her nose pin; instead, she was wearing a glass without which she could not even see. She was not at her home either, and a phone call greeted her as a doctor. She had no idea what was happening as she could not find any evidence of Avanti’s existence. She was having an identity crisis because everyone she knew didn’t recognize her as Antara Awasthi; additionally, she was now Dr. Antara Vashist, a top-tier professional in her field. She complained to the police, and the DCP trusted her when everyone else believed that she was making up stories on her own. Even though Vikash denied his relationship with her, he remembered her for saving his life once. There was a child named Avantika whom Antara could not save, so, according to the doctors, she was just making up stories around the people she met in real life.
Soon, Antara helped the police discover Rujuta’s, Raja Ghosh’s wife, body. In this reality, Raja Ghosh married Sheela, and they lived happily. The police asked Raja Ghosh to come and confess. The DCP described the events from the past, and as it turned out, he was the boy Antara saved 25 years ago, Anay. On the other hand, Antara came to know about Anay’s story from Abhishek. He told her that what she was saying had all been written in a book called “2:12”. A psychiatrist who used to talk to Anay wrote that book. Anay talked about Antara coming from the future and saving him from the fire brigade accident, but nobody believed it. People even made fun of him, so his mother decided to leave the locality forever. Antara felt guilty knowing what Anay had to face, but she was more eager to bring everything back to the reality she was living as a nurse. Vikash, in this reality, is married to Bhavna. However, Antara caught him with a woman named Sara. She asked him from whom he bought the house, as she thought this might lead to Anay. He told her that it was under a woman’s name. He took her to the woman’s house, the exact location where she awoke after speaking with Anay for the first time; it was called “Shikha Vats.” She came to realize that the DCP was Anay, and she was in some sort of a serious relationship with him.
When she confronted Anay, she understood that Anay had no intention of letting her return to the reality she desired. Anay waited for many years in front of the Bluecross Hospital to find Antara as she told him about the hospital back in 1996. Antara Vashist jumped in front of a car and died. To bring her back to life, Anay needed to convince Anay from 25 years back not to wait for Antara so that Anatara’s reality never changes. Later, we see that Antara is alive and happily living with Avanti. She even helps the police to recover Rujuta’s body, and in the end, she meets with Anay. This Anay doesn’t know about Antara, or he forgot about her.","['Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']","A woman gets an opportunity to save the life of a 12-year old boy who witnessed a death during a thunderstorm which happened 25 years ago, by getting connected through the television set during a similar storm in the present.","Guest iin London,Hate Story 2,Kaali Khuhi,The Girl on the Train,Chhorii,Pihu"

The two leave and decide to spend the night together at Veer's home, but Veer stops Zoe from continuing. He tells her that the time is not right. Zoe leaves infuriated. Veer keeps following Zoe, who finally confronts him and asks him not to follow her.

There is a flashback scene where Leena and Raghuvendra ""Raghu"" Singh have the same conversation back in Udaipur.

Back to the present day, Veer drops her for an interview at the office of the Mehta Group, and they slowly begin their relationship. Raj, who is affiliated with the Mehta Group, is an ex-medical student who ran away from Udaipur and now owns several restaurants in Delhi, including the café at which Zoe hangs out very often. Raj, who is good friends with Zoe, tells her the story of his childhood sweetheart, Leena, implying that he is a grown-up Raghu. He tells her that he used to behave with Leena just as Veer acts with Zoe, recites his childhood memories with Leena to Zoe, and tells her how he asked Leena for a dance together.

Again in a flashback, it is seen that Raghu and Leena used to meet each other secretly and how Raghu left everything for Leena and moved for her to Delhi, discontinuing his studies to be with Leena.

Her mother convinces Zoe that she can't possibly have both her love and career together. She goes to meet Veer's parents but leaves crying. Veer relays to Raj what Zoe did, and Raj, convinced that he influenced Zoe towards behaving this way, responds by getting her the job.

Some days later, Zoe sees Veer with another girl. Heartbroken, she hangs out with multiple people but doesn't happen to like any of them. She goes to a bar with a guy and gets drunk, but he refuses to drop her at her home. Veer picks her and drops her at her house. He says that he can't enter a relationship of compromises with Zoe and breaks up with her. The next day he informs her about a new job in the Himalayas and is leaving for two years, explaining that he has as much right to be focused on his career as does she, and bids her goodbye. Zoe gets a proposal from the Mehta family for marriage, but she refuses. When Zoe meets Raghu, he tells her that he met Leena one last time, when he realized he lost the person he was before with Leena and finds that she is pregnant. He leaves from there, gets into a cab, and goes to the airport. He adds that he still misses Leena but is helpless now. He starts crying, and Zoe comforts him. Raghu tells her that she shouldn't make the same mistake he made. Zoe leaves for the Himalayas to reunite with Veer. She sees Veer sleeping outside. She goes and lays on top of him. She says that she won't balance between love & work ever, but still, she wanted to be with him. Veer asks whether she will leap with him, to which she agrees, and they reunite.","['Drama', 'Romance']","When professional ambitions clash with personal feelings for a modern-day couple, a love story from a bygone era may offer some wisdom.","Dilwale,Teri Meri Kahaani,Ek Paheli Leela,Hate Story IV,Haseen Dillruba,Jug Jugg Jeeyo"

Saira's boyfriend breaks up with her and leaves in a huff.After this, Shiv and Saira spend a lot of time together and grow very close. On one of their nights together they go to a party with Radha, where they happen upon an eccentric psychic who knows about Saira's nightmares and tells her that her life is about to change drastically, that the events of her previous life will repeat themselves, and only she can fix them. Saira tearfully reveals to Shiv that she has a fear of water because her parents drowned after a car accident when she was two years old.A few days later, Shiv proposes to Saira. She acknowledges that they have an inexplicably special connection, but suggests that they put their love to the test by meeting with other strangers and seeing if they feel the same type of attraction. They go to a party where Shiv flirts with multiple women. Meanwhile, Saira is charmed by Zakir , a wealthy liquor baron. When Shiv comes over and meets Zakir, the tension is apparent but quickly dissolved. Later, Shiv tells Saira that he has to leave for Vienna for a week for a work commitment. Saira is upset to see him leave, but Shiv reassures her that this will only make their love stronger. While Shiv is gone, Zakir approaches Saira and she finds herself on a date with him. She tells Zakir that she finds herself drawn to him because he is exactly her type, but tells him that her heart belongs to Shiv. Zakir drugs Saira and kidnaps her, ordering his henchmen to kill Shiv.
Saira wakes up and finds herself trapped at Zakir's mansion on an island off the coast of Croatia. She demands that he let her go, but he refuses, saying that he spent his whole life looking for her. He explains that they were madly in love in a previous life, but were separated. He refuses to let this happen again. When she refuses to believe him, he shows her a collection of uncannily accurate paintings he made of her at various ages. Thinking he is crazy, she attempts to escape but ends up falling into the ocean, which triggers her memory of her previous life.Hundreds of years ago, Saira was the warrior princess Saiba . She was in love with Kaabir , a fellow warrior from her tribe. Their kingdom is threatened by the Muraakis, led by a wise old ruler .

Kaabir attempts to take Saiba back, but she reveals that she and Jilaan have fallen in love. On their wedding night, a comet falls and the Muraaki ruler realizes that this will be a fateful night. Kaabir ambushes Jilaan and Saiba. He murders Jilaan by wounding him and having him thrown in the ocean. Saiba jumps into the ocean to save him, but to no avail.

The Muraaki ruler forebodes that these events will repeat.Having remembered everything, Saira agrees to marry Zakir if he promises to spare Shiv. Shiv returns to Budapest and cannot find Saira anywhere, when he sees the announcement of her engagement in the newspaper. He goes to their engagement party and sadly congratulates Saira, believing that she is marrying Zakir for his money. Later, they meet in secret and Shiv helps her escape the island.

Zakir ambushes them on the barge and has Shiv drowned, in a scene reminiscent of their previous deaths. This time, however, Saira is able to save Shiv when she jumps in. Zakir is killed, and the two soulmates are finally united.The film ends with Shiv humorously telling their children to not believe Saira if she tells them any far-fetched stories about reincarnation, showing that he is still oblivious to the events of their previous lives.","['Action', 'Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Romance', 'Thriller']","An inseparable couple Saira and Shiva find themselves in a complicated situation when a stranger claims to be her reincarnated lover from their previous lifetime, hellbent on destroying their relationship and winning her back.","Shikara,1920: Evil Returns,1920 London,Halahal,Boss,Kaali Khuhi"

8698956,Lupt,Horror Thriller family car road doll girl cottage man stroller back figure begins,Horror Thriller Haunted visions family events disturbing workaholic vacation detour leads unsettling stranger chilling,"Harsh Tandon, a workaholic businessman, announces to his subordinates about the new merger his company made. His daughter, Tanu is a model dating a photographer, Rahul Saxena. She returns home from work to the lights flickering suddenly, and a weird voice coming from her brother Sam's room. She finds a skull in his closet and an ominous figure scares her. Tanu calls for her mother, Shalini and the figure is revealed to be Sam. Sam, in disappointment, announced that he is going to run away to America because no one appreciates his jokes. The next day, Shalini asks Harsh if they can go on a family road trip but Harsh rejects her request, saying he has to focus on his business.

On his way to work, Harsh sees a young girl crossing the road, in which he quickly stops the car only to see no one. In shock, he requests his chauffeur to drive him somewhere else instead of his office. Harsh goes to visit and consult a psychiatrist who suggests that he is suffering from hallucinations and that he should take a break from work. Meanwhile on a date, Rahul inquires Tanu about her father's distant behavior. At his office, Harsh hallucinates a spectral figure staring at him.

After consulting his psychiatrist, he decides to go on a vacation with his family. Some moments later, he gets the news that his manager had recently died on-site from an accident. He gives his subordinate Tyagi all the responsibilities, and has a small talk with a man named Satish. While the Tandon family at home prepare for their vacation, Tanu convinces Rahul to come with them. They stop at a petrol station along the way. Tanu goes to buy snacks at the station's convenience store, and upon returning, she bumps into a mysterious man dressed all in black. The silence in the car is boring Sam; in an attempt to liven up his family and Rahul, Sam tells a joke but nobody laughed. After fueling the car, the road gets blocked as due to an accident that occurred there. Harsh decides to takes another route, which its longer than the original route but without signs or lights. The Tandons spot a man on the road, who is the same man Tanu bumped into at the petrol station. He asks the family their destination, but they don't respond, while Sam jokes about having a corpse in the car.

Later, the family see a stroller carrying a doll on the road. Sam tries to scare everyone by acting childishly, in the hopes of fooling them that the doll is possessed and has attacked him. His prank proved to be futile as Sam didn't accomplish scaring anybody, but only to get slapped by his angry father. Everyone returns to the car, and so does Sam. Harsh asks him to remove the stroller from the road. After removing the stroller, Sam is shocked to see it reappear on the road. He throws it away this time, only for the stroller to push itself back onto the road. A while later, Harsh hallucinates a ghost, and the car begins to break down. Sam is alone in the car when the radio starts playing static noise saying that ""everyone will die,"" despite that there is no signal in that area. A car stops near them, which is the very same man they came across a while back. The man introducing himself as Dev Shukla tells the family that there is no garage nearby, but he offers them to stay at his cottage for the night. After some consideration, the family agrees to go. Upon their arrival to the cottage, the family spots a swing that's swaying by itself, Dev suggests that it might be the wind. After unpacking the car, the family enter the cottage.

Dev asks for their destination which Harsh says is Nainital. Dev adds that there is no help here. Tanu tells her mother that she is uncomfortable there. Meanwhile, Sam is alone and sees a doll's foot. He gets closer, and realizes the doll is almost identical the one he saw on the road. He then hears a child's giggle going behind him and looks back to see that the doll is now crying blood. Tanu comes, and the doll disappears. Outside Sam sees a young girl holding the doll, but again when Tanu turns to see, the girl and the doll vanish. Tanu tells Rahul about how she is bored of Sam's pranks and childish antics. In his frustration and boredom, Sam takes a knife and starts piercing it through the wall. As a result of his son's obnoxious and destructive behavior, Harsh angrily says that he is disowning Sam. Sam's voice begins to change, ominously saying, ""Everyone will die"". Now, Sam is outside, and he suddenly feels a sensation on the swing. Dev goes to talk to Sam, in which Sam goes on the road after him. Rahul goes outside to talk to him, and Sam says he is doing nothing. Sam tells everything he saw to Rahul and begs to return. However, Rahul does not take him seriously, Sam is all alone.

At the cottage, Harsh sees a woman in red clothes, and when he looks again, the figure disappears. Tanu informs her parents and Rahul that the car has been fixed. Harsh is now alone in the cottage. The lights then begin to flicker violently, and when the power goes out, Harsh goes to find his family. He hears noises which include a girl laughing. After a long search, he finally sees the ghost, the lights come back on and Tanu checks on him. In that specific room, they see some disturbing pictures. In fear, Harsh wants to leave. Meanwhile, as Sam walks on the road, he suddenly spots the same stroller from earlier. He follows it, and then witnesses the ghost girl singing ""Happy Birthday to Riya"" with the doll. Sam has an eye-to-eye moment with the girl, and then turns around to get jump-scared by the same woman that Harsh saw. Sam runs for his life until he reaches the cottage, gravely injured and white from the shock. When Sam begins to have a violent nosebleed, Harsh calls for an ambulance, only to hear a woman crying on the receiving end. Tanu begins to experience difficulty breathing for reasons unknown, and Rahul is asked to go get an inhaler. In his state of shock, Sam says ""the girl"" before seeing the ghostly woman again and dying as a result.

The family suspects that Dev killed Sam as he is the only one missing. Rahul and Harsh put Sam's lifeless body in the trunk, and continued their trip. Shalini asks for Sam's whereabouts, but Harsh refuses to answer for a moment. Harsh stops the car as Tanu is having her breathing problems again. Shalini is outside too, but now with a gun and demanding for Sam. Shalini sees Sam and follows him and the rest follow Shalini but lose her. Shalini runs behind Sam and goes straight towards a tree, thus losing consciousness. Tanu finds her first.

The three, Harsh, Rahul, and Tanu continue the trip. Shalini is put next to Tanu. Harsh sees a ghostly figure between them. Shalini hears Sam calling for her and regains consciousness. She continues to hear Sam and some smacking in the trunk. She asks Harsh to stop the car, while threatening him with death if he refuses to do so. Shalini then jumps out of the car and says ""you will all die,"" before dying herself. Shalini also saw the same ghost before dying just as her son did.

Now the remaining three members  continue on the road. Harsh sees signs of Lucknow on the road and asks Rahul to take the car a little back. He is surprised that Lucknow is still 145 miles away despite driving for hours, and that he also sees the board of Dev's cottage. Harsh thinks a lot about what happened and tells Rahul to drive back to the cottage. There, Harsh finds Dev and confronts him about his identity. Dev explains that he is a writer, and the family left their baggage at his home, before asking Harsh the whereabouts of Shalini and Sam. Harsh responds that his wife and son are both deceased. Dev mentions that there was an accident on that road that killed a family of three, and thus confirms all connections regarding the stroller, the little girl, and the doll. Harsh, in guilt, holds himself responsible for the death of his wife and son.

Harsh then tells Dev the whole story of what occurred two years prior to the current events and supernatural encounters that lead to the tragic deaths of his wife and son. His biggest competitor was another businessman by the name of Vinod Kumar. One evening, Vinod attended the same company party as Harsh. Harsh was talking with Satish, the same man he had a small heated talk with earlier in the film, expressing how envious he was of Vinod winning the Entrepreneur of The Year award and title. At the party, Harsh meets Vinod's family, his wife Geeta dressed in red, and his young daughter Riya with her doll, who invites him to her birthday party. As Vinod and his family left the party to return home, Satish warns Harsh about driving home under the influence of alcohol. Ignoring Satish's concern, the drunk Harsh speeds his car and hits Vinod's car, causing the vehicle to crash into the Lucknow sign. The Kumar family are gravely injured, but slightly alive. Satish begs Harsh to help Vinod and his family, but he makes no effort to save them, and abandons them for death.

Harsh begins to feel guilty and regretful upon the revelation of his actions. There is flickering in the house. He sees the little girl. Dev denies the existence of the spirits. Tanu starts having her breathing problems again but now the inhaler has finished. There is another flickering and a storm. She sees the woman, revealed to be Vinod's wife, Geeta, which everyone sees.

8484942,India&apos;s Most Wanted,Action Adventure Thriller team time GHOST bomb decides inside attacks hotel place tourists leave man discreetly leaving,Action Adventure Thriller criminal group intelligence officers embark top secret mission track wanted international,"A man quietly leaves The Pune Kitchen hotel after discreetly leaving a bag containing a bomb. Moments later, the bomb explodes, killing several people, and injuring many more.

At the PMO, New Delhi, a heated meeting takes place where a top ranking official berates the spy agencies for the continuous failures in the intelligence causing more attacks on India in the recent times. A group, led by Prabhat Kumar, volunteers to track down the mastermind behind these attacks, Yusuf , who according to an intel report, is hiding in Nepal posing as a doctor. His superior, Rajesh Singh, is soundly against this as Nepal is strategically important for India, but gives in finally but with an ultimatum of four days.

The team, which consists of Shaumik, Javed, Amit, Bittu and Ravi, enters Kathmandu under the guise of tourists. There, Prabhat meets an informant known as Laluji who tells him that he might have seen the person who they are looking for at a house in Pokhra, a it near the capital. Meanwhile, ISI gets a tip of the agents as they become suspicious of their body language and the fact that they are in Kathmandu as tourists without any kids or ladies. They activate their sources, but it is of no use. Infuriated, they increase their manpower and ammunitions, just in case. On the other hand, Prabhat decides to go to the place where Laluji had seen GHOST. While following Laluji, Prabhat identifies Yusuf as the latter passes him on a motorbike. He alerts Singh, who is forced to tell about the ongoing developments with his senior management, who derides him for this hasty decision without keeping anyone in look, but decides to help the team.

Things take a turn when Prabhat is alerted about the ISI following the team. With time running out, Prabhat decides to nab Yusuf on the same night. He requests a backup, and a three men local police team joins them, unpleasantly surprising him. As the team goes inside the house, the Indian ambassador receives a call that the person they suspected is a turbine engineer and not a doctor, creating more pressure on the team. A now visibly angry Prabhat calls the ambassador and gives him five minutes to call out the Nepal team or the team will go inside. In the meantime, the ISI realises that the Indians are there to arrest Yusuf from Pokhra, where he is hiding, and they leave to confront their Indian counterparts.

With no option left, Prabhat and his team charges inside despite warning from the cop, and discovers Yusuf along with Maachis, another wanted terrorist. They take the two with them and immediately leave for India. The ISI are hot on their heels and they nearly catch up with the Indians, but Prabhat successfully manage to cross Nepal border and the gate is closed as the ISI approaches. It is revealed that the chief security officer was convinced by Prabhat to help them in this mission.

The arrests of Yusuf and Maachis are made public, and the team celebrate it quietly.","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Thriller']",A group of intelligence officers embark on a top secret mission to track down a wanted international criminal.,"Aiyaary,Dishoom,Baby,Pathaan,Batla House,Holiday"

11112808,Cirkus,Comedy Drama twins electric shocks adopt circus fur twin orphanage mistakenly portrayed sets bro narrative,Comedy Drama sets birth identical twins accidentally separated town coincidentally lot confusion misunderstanding people mistake,"In 1944, the narrative begins with Dr. Roy Jamnadas, portrayed by Murali Sharma, who is deeply engrossed in exploring the nature versus nurture theory. He stumbles upon two sets of identical twins left at the doorstep of the orphanage he oversees. Inspired by his own adoptive brother, Joy, Dr. Roy makes a life-altering decision to separate these twin pairs, placing them with different families in two distinct cities. The couples who adopt these twins name them Roy and Joy, in honor of Dr. Roy and his beloved brother Joy.

The first set of twins, Roy 1, played by Ranveer Singh, and Joy 1, portrayed by Varun Sharma, are taken in by a couple living in Ooty. The twins' father initially runs a circus, and after his unfortunate demise, Roy 1 and Joy 1 assume the responsibility of managing the circus. Roy 1 possesses an extraordinary connection with electricity, rendering him immune to electric shocks. He harnesses this unique ability to perform electrifying tricks, earning him the moniker 'Electric Man.' Coincidentally, whenever Roy 1 encounters electricity, Roy 2 experiences painful electric shocks.

The narrative then progresses by three decades, where significant changes have transpired in the lives of the twins. Roy 1, now a husband to Mala, played by Pooja Hegde, faces a heart-wrenching dilemma. While Mala yearns to adopt a child from the Jamnadas Orphanage, Roy 1 staunchly opposes the idea. Meanwhile, Roy 2 is deeply in love with Bindu, although her father, Rai Bahadur, harbors doubts concerning Roy 2. This suspicion stems from a previous encounter, where he mistakenly believed Roy 1 to be Roy 2, leading to an erroneous assumption that Roy 2 was betraying Bindu. A humorous series of events unfolds as Roy 2 and Joy 2 embark on a journey to Ooty, where they are planning to purchase a tea estate.

However, chaos and misunderstanding ensue as locals frequently mistake one twin pair for the other. This confusion is further compounded by the intrusion of a group of robbers, Momo, Mango, and Chikki, who initially attempt to pilfer from the twins. Their plans are thwarted when Roy 2 utilizes his unique ability to administer electric shocks. Subsequently, their boss, Polson Dada, becomes determined to exact revenge. The twins also cross paths with several colorful characters, including Nagmani, a dubious cab driver, and Bagheera, a reformed dacoit turned hotel owner. Roy 2 mistakenly perceives them as members of a formidable criminal organization determined to rob them. To further complicate matters, Roy 2 and Joy 2 encounter Mala, leading them to mistakenly believe that she is the ringleader of the alleged criminal gang.

In a separate subplot, Roy 1 contemplates gifting a diamond necklace to Mala, but a mix-up at the jewelry store leads to Roy 2 inadvertently receiving the necklace, creating additional layers of confusion. Meanwhile, Bindu, completely unaware of the real situation, contemplates ending her relationship with Roy 2, assuming he is married to Mala.

The climax of the story occurs at the circus, where both sets of twins finally come face to face. Dr. Jamnadas seizes the opportunity to reveal the truth behind his actions and the underlying purpose of separating the twins. As the twins reconcile and comprehend the reasoning behind Dr. Jamnadas' actions, Roy 1 and Mala decide to adopt a child from the orphanage. Simultaneously, Roy 2 and Bindu make plans for their impending marriage.

The story concludes with the introduction of five orphaned boys, Gopal, Laxman 1, Madhav, Laxman 2, and Lucky, who arrive at the orphanage, setting the stage for further adventures and bonding among the new family of adoptive parents and their children.","['Comedy', 'Drama']","Two sets of identical twins are accidentally separated at birth.

15238986,Plan A Plan B,Comedy Romance divorce marriage Unique Matrimony’ birth friend things introduced end wife aka,Comedy Romance secret paths attract matchmaker marriage successful divorce lawyer cross explores opposites coexist,"Kaustubh aka Kosty is introduced as a stiff divorce lawyer who stops at nothing to get divorces for his clients.

Nirali is a psychologist turned marriage counsellor who has taken over her mother’s business, ‘Unique Matrimony’. She uses unconventional methods for picking matches.

Kosty and Nirali are introduced to each other when the latter’s new office is right next to the former’s.They begin arguing right from their first meeting after Kosty suggests an eight per cent cut for every match she sends to him since he believes most marriages are destined for divorce.

During a conversation between Nirali and her surprisingly mature nephew, Kabir, it is revealed that she is still not over her ex-boyfriend, Varun.

On the other hand, Kosty is sleeping with random women and crashing at his friend Girish’s house, landing him in trouble with his wife.

Nirali is hurt when she overhears Kosty insulting her and saying that nobody would date her and that if she had a boyfriend, he would kill themself.

Eventually, Nirali meets Runjhun, and is shocked to know that she is his wife. In truth, Kosty has been refusing to file for divorce.

Runjhun reveals that his true personality is completely opposite to how he is acting nowadays. He is actually a romantic individual, but their marriage went downhill after she cheated on him with her boss.

Nirali gets drunk and phones Kosty, calling him out on being a hypocrite who can’t deal with his own feelings and get a divorce, but goes around helping others end their marriage.

Kosty wants to confront her on this but opts not to. He meets her mother, Kiran, and builds a great rapport with her. She invites him to her 60th birthday party.Nirali’s blindfold experiment to find matches is a massive success, and even ends up accidentally finding someone for Kosty’s employee.

At Kiran’s behest, Kosty and Nirali decide not to fight until her birthday and eventually become friendly towards each other.

Kabir finds Kosty and tells him about her past. Varun had actually passed away due to a heart attack and Nirali never got the chance to say goodbye. She carries that baggage to this day. Kabir asks him to set her up with someone.

For a new experiment, Nirali needs a man to test a compatibility pattern. Kosty agrees to be a volunteer for this.

The test involves a series of questions regarding their hypothetical relationship. The result comes out as only 35% compatible.

Kosty refuses to accept this and asks for a retest. Nirali questions if he has a better way and in the heat of the moment, they end up kissing.

They are about to sleep with each other but Kosty sees Runjhun’s photo and stops. Nirali understands and suggests they try again tomorrow.

After the incident, Kosty seems troubled. He disappears for four days and ghosts Nirali as well, leaving her hurt. She vents in front of her friend about how she fell for him and that it was her mistake. She decides to let go of him.

On the day of Kiran’s birthday, Kosty returns. He tries to apologise to Nirali but she keeps avoiding him, thinking he isn’t interested in her.

During a dance, Kosty convinces her and their chemistry is apparent to all those present. However, Runjhun also arrives and thanks her for fixing things between her and Kosty.

She assumes that the two are back together after Runjhun took her advice to fix things between them, and is left distraught.

While she is crying about it with her friend, Kosty tries to clear things up again. He reveals that by ‘fixed’ they meant that the two went through with the divorce.

Immediately after what happened between him and Nirali, he flew to Kolkata and talked it out with Runjhun. It took four days for the divorce to be completed, which is why he went missing.

By falling in love with Nirali, Kosty had finally come to terms with the fact that his and Runjhun’s relationship was over.

After revealing the truth, Kosty proposes to her. Nirali simply chuckles at the manner of the proposal, hinting that she had accepted. They’re joined by their loved ones, who are all happy that the two found someone.

Four months later, Nirali is seen fixing relationships of Kosty’s clients and he complains about this, but she just replies that he can take ‘8 per cent’; what he had offered her at the start.

Kosty asks to get married again but she borrows his lines from the film again and replies why get married when you can just ‘do it’. The final exchange shows that they’re not rigid in their approaches anymore.","['Comedy', 'Romance']","Follows a matchmaker who believes marriage is for everyone except herself, and a successful divorce lawyer with a secret, who cross paths, and explores if opposites coexist or attract.","Welcome Back,Jug Jugg Jeeyo,Ki &amp; Ka,Tiku weds Sheru,Badhaai Do,Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani"

The pattern that the murderer follows is chopping the feet of the victim after killing them. Whenever the investigation authorities are informed of the body, it is found inside a suitcase with the feet of the victim chopped off. The film begins with this serial killer having committed murders, in the same way, a couple of times before, and the CBI is taking over with the 3rd murder surfacing, and on a hunt to look out for the perpetrator. The investigation team quickly discovers that the murderer has a foot fetish.

As Vivaan and his investigation team continue their inquiry into the murders, Vivaan, Harsh, and Rishabh come across plenty of leads. They follow the leads, and most of them take them to dead ends with no solid proof that their suspect might be the killer. The team almost catches the killer at the graveyard of his first victim but misses him by a fraction of a second. The hunt to find the killer forms the plot of the film.

Vivaan and his team have no lead to take the murder investigation forward. The pressure from their seniors is palpable. Soon, the 4th victim of the murderer surfaces, now with the “Footfairy” engraved on the victim’s dead body. The force informs the public and the media of the existence of a serial killer named “Footfairy,” makes the public aware of what he does to his victims, and starts a hotline for the public to inform the police if they come across any suspicious person.

Vivaan slowly starts losing hope but then his girlfriend casually mentions to him a weird restaurant owner who seems to obsess over the feet of women who visit his restaurant. This makes Vivaan change his tangent and he starts enquiring about the restaurant owner, Joshua Mathews, a resident of Goa. On enquiring, Vivaan comes across plenty of women who reveal that on many occasions, Joshua spoke to them about how to keep one’s feet neat and clean, which most of them found weird. One of the foot spa workers also reveals the way Joshua used to look at her feet made her feel uncomfortable. Vivaan starts tracking Joshua and comes across plenty of information corroborating the fact that he might be the prime suspect, aka the Footfairy. He comes across details such as Joshua going out of town for days after every murder takes place, his ex-girlfriend filing an FIR against him for physically harming her, and most of the victims visitng his restaurant a few days before they ended up getting killed. Vivaan finally gets the nod to do a search of Joshua’s home and collect a DNA sample to corroborate his theory. The fifth victim of the Footfairy turns out to be a friendly 15-year-old neighbor of Vivaan, which makes him confront Joshua and assault him. Vivaan and his team finally get the DNA results back, unfortunately with inconclusive results, putting the entire investigation on the backfoot again.

In the end, Vivaan is seen attending the funeral of his superior and revealing that he left his job with CBI under pressure because of the defamation case filed by Joshua Mathews. Vivaan is now settled in Bangalore with his partner. On his way back, he stops near the railway track where the last victim’s body was found. He comes across a child who unexpectedly describes the killer, and Vivaan realizes that the killer is still out there and probably looks as normal as most people he sees around himself. An end credit scene of Footfairy has a white woman walking on her own in a seemingly snow-covered place, being attacked in the same way how the other victims in Mumbai were targeted and killed, making it clear that the killer is on the move, out of the city of Mumbai & shifted to another city to carry out his murders.

He tells them that with the editor's help, he had rented an apartment in his friend's outhouse located in a remote part of Goa. The place looks haunted and the owner is a paralyzed, elderly man who uses a wheelchair and is the father of a young girl, Maya . Maya falls in love upon seeing Ronnie, who is recovering from his breakup with ex-girlfriend Priya , who moved to London.

Maya phones her sister to reveal her feelings for Ronnie and steals a picture of Ronnie out of his photo-frame. She also happens to spot a picture of herself on his desktop, and this makes her think that he is likewise in love with her. This is not the case. It was only by chance that Ronnie had randomly snapped the picture during his ferry ride while traveling to the new place, before he had even met her. Ronnie is not in love with her, but he thinks she is strange and cute, so he plans a date-night at a nightclub. There, he bumps into Nancy , Priya's step-sister. Maya is upset when Ronnie and Nancy begin dancing together.

On their way back from the nightclub, Ronnie drives drunk and their SUV collides with a scooter driven by Nancy. Due to the impact, Nancy falls off the road and rolls down a slope. Ronnie panics and turns hysterical, while the cool and composed Maya, who is a trained nurse, rushes to save the girl. Maya announces that Nancy is dead, and persuades Ronnie to flee the scene so that the two of them can avoid getting caught.

The next morning, Nancy is found dead, the accident is all over the news, and the Goan cops are on the case. Ronnie, while all the time afraid that he might be caught, finds himself involved in the case in strange ways. For one thing, Priya comes back to India from London to hunt for Nancy's killers. Then again, as a journalist, Ronnie is ordered by Karan to go to the crash site and report on all aspects of the incident. He does as he is told, and during his work, he meets Inspector Moses , who suspects that Priya killed Nancy for her share of the family inheritance and that Ronnie is Priya's partner-in-crime. Meanwhile, Maya continues to protect Ronnie. Ronnie had told his boss that his SUV is in the garage , but Maya dumps it in a lake so that no one can trace it. She even takes him to the spot and shows him the immersed SUV in the lake.

Investigations reveal that Nancy would have lived even after she was hit by the car, but someone had strangled her. Priya visits Ronnie at his outhouse and requests him to help her find the murderer. On her return trip, her brakes fail and she crashes, but is not hurt. Soon, Priya and Ronnie warm up to each other again. Ronnie even excuses himself from Maya's birthday dinner so that he can spend the night with Priya. Maya then finds out from Ronnie's office that he is not there but is with Priya. Maya stalks them and finds Ronnie and Priya having sex. Before sneaking out, an angry Maya feeds Ronnie's pet puppy Bobby to her pet alligator.

Priya finds out that Ronnie had been at the same bar and that he had even met Nancy the night she was killed. She feels cheated and betrayed. Priya also becomes suspicious of Maya, lands up at the outhouse and starts accusing Maya of everything – including Nancy's murder. They get into a brawl. Maya calls Ronnie for help. Ronnie arrives but she attacks him on the head from behind and he suffers a black-out. Maya rushes to leave but finds Inspector Moses outside and kills him after he voices his suspicions that she is responsible for Nancy's death. Ronnie wakes up and discovers a cabin with pictures of Maya, himself, Nancy, Priya, Moses, and even Bobby on the walls, with red crosses on those who were dead. Maya reappears and reveals her role in the murders. She also tells him that she had previously killed her own sister by pushing her from the boat in a lake in a fit of jealousy.

Maya then blindfolds Ronnie and takes him to the top of a lighthouse that she called Maya's Kingdom to exchange wedding vows with him. She tells him to make love to her and he obliges. All this while, Priya is dangling in mid-air on a suspended chair. Ronnie lights a cigarette and spills a glass of wine over it causing a fire to break out. Maya pulls the gun on him but Ronnie snatches the gun from her hand, which he could have done earlier too, and throws her off the lighthouse, leaving her dangling from the rod along with Priya. Ronnie manages to pull Priya on top of the lighthouse and saves her. After that they both try to save Maya, but she lets go and falls to her death into the deep waters.

The DSP is convinced by Ronnie's story and tells him that he will be out on bail. In return, the editor promises to use the paper's good relations with a government minister to stop the DSP's upcoming transfer.

After the DSP and editor leaves, Ronnie starts laughing, and the film goes into a flashback where everything supposedly done by Maya is shown to have been done by Ronnie. It is revealed that it was Priya and Ronnie's plan to kill Nancy and get all property and put all blame on Maya, and that she truly loved him.","['Crime', 'Romance', 'Thriller']","A journalist, who is still in love with his ex-girlfriend, becomes the obsession of his landlord's daughter.","Jalsa,Aseq,Badla,No One Killed Jessica,Ittefaq,Samrat &amp; Co."

Zandulal finds out that the two crooks fled to Durban and begs the bank chairman for time to look for the two and prove his innocence.

In Durban, diamonds worth millions have been stolen from the International Diamond Centre by an underworld gang led by Marcos . Senior inspector Arjun Singh  is determined to catch Marcos and his gang. Arjun is married to Kajal Khurana , the daughter of the commissioner of the police Khurana .

1891884,Once Upon a Time in Mumbai Dobaara!,Action Crime Drama police kill love hav car ano henchmen arrives murder hospital escape,Action Crime Drama mentor killing gangster power rule actress process falls aspiring finds protege fallen leads enmity,"The film begins where its predecessor ended, with reigning don Shoaib Khan earning respect after his mentor, Sultan Mirza handed over his power to Shoaib in 1975, only to be assassinated by him as revenge for a public humiliation immediately after.

Twelve years later, in 1987, Khan is still a charismatic, suave womaniser, who has extended his empire to the Middle East. His only friends are Javed , his former love Mumtaz, and Aslam, a teenager Khan met during a visit to the slums in which he grew up.

An older Khan returns to Bombay to kill Rawal, who opposed his ambition to take the reins in Bombay. Although the city was his first love, rising starlet Jasmine wins his heart. Khan advances Jasmine's career by rigging awards, and showers her with gifts; he becomes obsessed with her. He sends Aslam and another trustworthy aide, Jimmy, to kill Rawal. Jimmy fails, accidentally killing his girlfriend, Mona, and flees. He is soon captured by the police, hot on Khan's trail after learning about his arrival in Bombay. Jimmy, loyal to Khan, does not crack during his interrogation and is freed due to lack of evidence. The police intend to draw Khan out from hiding; he has eluded them for twelve years, and this is their last chance to take him on Indian soil.

Khan, suspicious that Jimmy has become a police informer, decides to kill him but Aslam offers to do the deed to deflect police attention. He, Dedh Tang and several thugs masquerade as rival biker gangs and stage a brawl. Plain-clothes police officers try to control the chaos when Aslam corners Jimmy. When a police officer stops Aslam, Khan appears out of nowhere, murders Jimmy and injures the policeman. A chase ensues; the police fail to catch the two, who escape in Khan's Mercedes.

Although Khan has bought Jasmine a house, she rejects his advances, saying that she has never seen him as being more than a friend. Angry and disappointed, Khan slaps her and tells her to leave. He angrily destroys the set of the film she is cast in, leaving with her a twenty-four-hour deadline to accept his proposal. Jasmine returns home to see that Khan has filled her house with expensive presents. Her mother is taken aback when Jasmine explains that Khan is a gangster with whom she'd prefer not to associate. Her family questions the sense in rejecting a man as powerful and dangerous as Khan.

Later in the night, Jasmine meets Aslam at his uncle's restaurant. He tries to explain his love for her, only to be interrupted and told that she is engaged and the two should stop seeing one another. Dejected and disappointed, Aslam meets with Khan, who seems unusually pensive. The two lament their relationships, not knowing they are both in love with the same woman. Just before Khan is about to reveal the name of his romantic interest, a phone rings – Khan, jubilant, announces that his proposal has been accepted and orders Aslam to pick up his new ""bhabhi,"" or sister-in-law.

Aslam arrives at the address Khan has given him and, much to his shock, sees Jasmine walking towards his car. Initially angry that he is still following her, the two realise that they have been caught up in a complicated affair – that Aslam, unbeknownst to Jasmine, works for Khan, and that Jasmine was the one he had been sent to pick up. Before either can speak, a car containing Rawal and his henchmen arrives at a distance. Rawal shoots Jasmine, having learned of her relationship with Khan and hoping that hurting her lure the gangster into a vulnerable position.

Jasmine remains unconscious at the hospital as Khan arrives. He accuses Aslam of being in love with his fiancée – an accusation which Aslam denies as Khan reveals in an attempt to pacify Aslam that he has masterminded a plan to murder Rawal and ensure his own dominance over the Mumbai underworld. Khan intends to fabricate a story of him feuding with Aslam to tempt Rawal and his rivals into contacting Aslam. The ""news"" reaches Rawal, who seems delighted at the prospect of being able to turn Khan's right-hand man against him.

When Rawal calls Aslam at the hospital, Aslam, now fully aware of Khan's feelings towards Jasmine, seems unsure whether to abide by Khan's plan. He reluctantly provides Rawal with an address, ending the phone call by telling him to ""murder the bastard."" Khan, lying in wait outside the address with a sniper rifle, kills Rawal and his henchmen when they arrive. Khan, having consolidated power, savours his victory and walks into a police station undeterred as a taunt to law enforcement. However, Dedh Tang accidentally reveals Aslam's feelings for Jasmine in the midst of celebration. Khan, infuriated, diverts the car to the hospital to confront Aslam, who has continued to stay with Jasmine as she recovers from being shot by Rawal. Knowing that his friend is in danger, Dedh Tang honks the horn of the car repeatedly after Shoaib and his henchmen enter the building, alerting Aslam to the danger and giving him time to escape. Entering to see an empty bed where Jasmine had before been laying, Khan realises that Dedh Tang had given him away.

Khan sends his aide Akbar to kill Aslam after he and Jasmine flee to Aslam's uncle's restaurant in Dongri. Aslam assures Jasmine that Khan, though violent, would never hurt him. Their conversation is interrupted by a car's horn honking – running outside, Aslam is ambushed by Akbar after discovering the body of Dedh Tang, who has been killed by Shoaib for aiding the couple in their escape. Aslam, though injured and initially losing the fight, kills Akbar with a shovel. He calls Khan to tell him that the murder of Dedh Tang has, in effect, erased his deep-seated loyalty to his former boss. Khan responds by telling Aslam that sending Akbar was a mistake, as he must be the one to kill the man he views as also having betrayed him by ""stealing"" Jasmine.

Aslam and Khan confront one another as the police, having been alerted to Khan's location by a storekeeper, descend upon Dongri. Shoaib rains down blows and insults upon Aslam, urging him to defend himself in front of Jasmine. Nevertheless, Aslam, who still feels indebted and bound to Khan, does not fight back until Inspector Sawant appears through the gathered crowd – even then, Aslam only pushes Khan away so that Khan is not shot by the officer. Reacting quickly, Khan draws a pistol of his own and shoots Sawant before turning his weapon on Jasmine and Aslam. Jasmine, through tears and while holding a bleeding Aslam, tells Khan that he is truly evil and will never have her love. Khan seems to recognise the truth in her words as he drops his weapon and stares at the couple. Just then, more police officers arrive on the scene and open fire on Khan, who, now injured, is dragged away by one of his henchmen. He and Aslam, both alive but bloodied, lock eyes and reach out for another, having finally put aside their differences.

In the last scene, a bullet-ridden, dejected Khan reads a letter in Urdu he was unable to give Jasmine in the cargo hold of a ship leaving the city forever.","['Action', 'Crime', 'Drama']","After killing his mentor, a gangster comes into power to rule over Mumbai.

They are tasked by their boss and kidnapping-gang leader Guniya Bhai to kidnap Roohi as part of a contract by a guy who wishes to marry her. However, a death in the family of the groom forces them to keep her in hiding in an abandoned woodwork shop so that the marriage can take place after the funeral. During their stay, Bhawra realizes that Roohi is actually possessed by a demonic spirit, which is corroborated by her father. Roohi was actually supposed to be married a year ago, but the groom and his family fled after seeing she was possessed.

Bhawra falls for Roohi and tries to coax the spirit from her body; Kattanni, on the other hand, is smitten by the demonic spirit, who identifies herself as Afza, and tries to bring her forward instead of Roohi so that he can talk to her. They learn that the demon is a Mudiyapairi  and she will not leave unless she gets married along with the girl she is possessing. Guniya Bhai, fearing the police investigation behind Roohi's kidnapping, instructs them to abandon her, but they refuse, forcing him to send his henchmen to get the job done. The henchmen get gravely injured while trying to assault Kattanni by Afza, and report this to Guniya.

Bhawra finds out from an old woman that the 'Mudiyapairi' has to be tricked into marrying a man who is already married, which makes her the mistress and forces her to leave the body she is possessing. The old woman had been possessed before by the same witch, and had exorcised the spirit, but not before the enraged spirit killed her supposed husband. The henchmen are attacked by Afza , so Bhawra, Roohi, and Kattanni leave for a village called Chimmattipur, where Bhawra marries a dog for him to trick the witch. However, the villagers chastise him for bringing a witch to their sacred village. Guniya Bhai arrives to take revenge but realizes that Afza has to get married in less than a day. Eager to rebuild his reputation, Guniya Bhai tells Afza she can marry the guy who had given the contract to marry Roohi.

Bhawra and Kattanni arrive at the wedding; Kattanni, decked in Bhawra's wedding attire, convinces Afza to marry him. They are interrupted by the old lady, who tells Afza the marriage is a fraud, and deceives her into believing by showing her the video of the dog wedding. She gets confused seeing Bhawra in the groom's attire and mistaking him to be Kattanni. An enraged Afza commands Bhawra to marry him but is stopped by Roohi.

The host apologizes for the delay and going backstage, furiously tells a lady called Nafisa to call Ayush, who has locked himself in a room. They break the door down to find out that Ayush has slit his wrist.

Then the film goes in flashback when he was in Bombay. A wealthy man Mr. Wadia discovers Ayush's incredible talents and asks him to take care of his mansion Wadia Manor in York in return of which he would pay for Ayush's educational expenses. Ayush is overjoyed to hear this and heads towards his journey to the mansion. Ayush is warmly received by both the housekeeper and the caretaker of the house. Ayush is more delighted to enter the York College of Music.

Three months later Ayush is doing some paperwork when he is hit with an onslaught of paranormal activities. Closed doors open by themselves. Lights start flickering. Ayush sees a white light beckoning him to come closer, but he is always stopped by a women's scream. He encounters a message written with dried blood in a room. He enlist help of Rose, a fellow student at the college who possesses a second sight. As both investigate, they realize the secrets that they both have kept individually about events of the preceding three months have more consequences and they both might have a deeper connection with the current hauntings than they can imagine. Ayush informs her that he can hear voices of a machine, and he can see a white light calling to him but as soon as he goes near he hears a woman's scream which prevents him from touching the light.

He narrates what happened three months ago when he arrived at the mansion. He allowed the villagers to enter the mansion and listen to his music for some money. One day his actions were discovered by Meher Wadia  and she blackmailed him into giving her a performance or she will have him fired. During the performance that night, she gave Ayush a poison and tried to dump him at a place so that he could die a slow death. But Ayush hit her making her unconscious. While coming back to the mansion, he saw a supernatural being on the way and lost control over the car, resulting in a car accident in which Meher died.

To his surprise, nobody confronted him about Meher's death. Later these paranormal events began. Rose conducts an investigation on the basis of Ayush's story. She learns that Meher Wadia never visited York. During their investigation, Ayush and Rose fall in love with each other. Some time later Rose reaches a hospital in which she discovers that the Meher Wadia who visited Ayush was actually their classmate Tina who had been dead for three months. When she sees the date of her death, she is horrified. She confesses to Ayush that all the bad things are happening to Ayush due to her.

She narrates how her and Nafisa's roommate Vasudha was in love with a married man named Richard, but he was not ready to divorce his wife. One day she happily informed her friends that Richard was going to marry her as Richard's wife left him. But Rose was visited by the spirit of Richard's wife and was told that Vasudha had murdered her. She informed Richard of this, which was discovered by Vasudha and she committed suicide. They tried to save her and admitted her into a hospital. But she eventually died and her spirit got hold of Tina's body who was admitted in the same hospital. She had been tormenting Ayush since she knew that Rose was in love with him.

Rose and Ayush become convinced that they have to get rid of Vasudha's spirit and so they decide to visit a church. Vasudha attacks Nafisa, which prompts Rose to take her to a hospital where she makes another horrific discovery. She finds that Ayush is admitted into the same hospital and has been in a coma since the night Meher Wadia attacked him. Rose informs Nafisa that she has been communicating with Ayush's spirit all along. She explains that when the human body is in deep sleep, its spirit wanders off, but they are connected through a rope in the form of a white light. Eventually the spirit can re-enter the body by touching it. Ayush's spirit has tried to enter its body, but Vasudha has all along prevented it from happening. The next day Ayush's body was going to be removed from life support, which would result in his death.

Rose takes a hair of Ayush to make it touch Ayush's spirit, but as she is about to leave the hospital, Vasudha's spirit takes control of Ayush's body. She threatens Rose that she will destroy Ayush's body if she leaves. She tortures Rose by hurting Ayush's body. Rose informs Vasudha that she knew she would not be able to leave and then she kills herself. Her spirit appears and reveals that she has already sent Ayush's hair and a letter to Ayush through Nafisa. Rose fights and destroys Vasudha's spirit. At the same time, Ayush's spirit enters his body and he is saved.

The film goes back to where it has started. Ayush in a death-like state meets Rose and tells her that he wants to be with her. Rose tells him that he has to live and spread his music for her. She asks it as a return for her sacrifice. Ayush eventually recovers and becomes a renowned pianist and musician.","['Horror', 'Mystery', 'Romance']","A decade after 1920.

During an intense fight between the two families, Jaswinder ""Jassi"" Singh Randhawa's father and Balwinder ""Billu"" Singh Sandhu's uncle kill each other, on the night of Billu's wedding with Parmeet ""Pammi"" Kaur. Billu ultimately vows to remain unmarried until he kills Randhawa's son. Meanwhile, Jassi's mother flees the village along with Jassi, later settling in London.

Twenty-five years later, Jassi is a struggling immigrant in London. He is best friends with Pathan, who runs a club. Jassi decides to go to India because his father left him some land in Phagwara, Punjab. Although made aware of the rivalry by Pathan, he does not worry about it as he thinks that the rivalry is now forgotten. Back in Phagwara, Billu still searches for Randhawa's son with the help of his two younger brothers, Tito and Tony. Pammi yearns for marriage with Billu to be completed. Jassi arrives in India and meets Sukhmeet ""Sukh"" Kaur Sandhu on a train ride from New Delhi to Phagwara. Unbeknownst to Jassi, who flirts with her, Sukh is Billu's younger sister, who is returning to Phagwara after having completed her studies in Delhi. During the train ride, Jassi falls in love with her. Once he parts ways with Sukh upon landing in Phagwara, Jassi is offered a ride by Tony to a Gurudwara as the land behind the Gurudwara is Jassi's. Tony finds out that Jassi is Randhawa's son and tries to kill him in vain.

Jassi soon bumps into Billu at a temple as the villagers tell him that Billu would guide him to the land better. Billu is accompanied by his family and Sukh, who recognises Jassi, prompting Billu to invite Jassi to his house. Tony then reveals to Billu that Jassi is the person they were searching for these 25 years. Billu vows that he will kill Jassi as soon as he gets out of the Sandhu household. Jassi finds out that he is in the Sandhu household. Since there is a tradition in the Sandhu household that treats guests as 'akin to God' and forbids any killings in the house during the period, Jassi feigns injury by telling everyone he has broken his back and needs to say in the house for treatment. Enraged, Billu plans a number on Jassi's life.

Sukh's friend Tej ""Bobby"" Jaswal, a doctor, finds out that Jassi has been lying all along, but confides this secretly to Sukh alone. One day, Jassi informs a local inspector that Billu and his brothers are hell bent on killing him. The inspector promises to escort him out, but instead leads Jassi to a dilapidated mansion where he is confronted by Billu and his men, revealing that he was in league with Billu, who along with his group starts attacking Jassi once the inspector leaves. However, in an attempt to escape, Jassi eventually lands back into the Sandhu household again.

After a few more days, during the Lohri celebrations, Billu announces that Bobby and Sukh will be engaged the very next day. Both are initially taken aback, but eventually agree. Jassi finds out that Sukh loves him too. Pammi reveals to Sukh and Bobby that she planned this engagement because she wanted Jassi, who she now knows through the land papers in his bag, is Randhawa's son, to escape; as the engagement is taking place in the Gurudwara, nobody will be in the Sandhu household. Jassi, meanwhile, decides to fight Billu's brothers so he can stop this rivalry. Sukh escapes from the engagement after strong prodding from Pammi and, surprisingly, Bobby himself, and reunites with Jassi. She wants to elope with him but Jassi wishes to end this rivalry, no matter what. Following an intense confrontation and fight between the duo, Billu's mother convinces him to forget about this rivalry. He decides to let go and forgive Jassi on the condition that he marry Sukh, while announcing his own marriage to Pammi after all.","['Action', 'Comedy', 'Romance']","A guest tries to stay inside the house of a man who can't kill him unless he's outside, because of believing guest to be equal to God.","Chaman Bahaar,Raat Akeli Hai,Race 3,Laxmii,Jagga Jasoos,Love Hostel"

On the way home, Jai Kishen bumps into Raju Coolie, a railway station porter who proudly wears his badge - ""Coolie No. 1"". Raju is known among his fellow porters for being heroic, recently having gotten a drug dealer Mahesh arrested. When Raju is smitten by Sarah's photo, Jai Kishen hatches a plan to get the poor porter married to Sarah and exact his revenge.

In the process, Sarah's sister Anju falls for Deepak.

Jeffrey gets Sarah married to Raju, not knowing that he is just a poor porter. When Raju returns home with Sarah after the wedding, he pretends that his ""father"" Mahendra Pratap Singh has thrown him out of the house for getting married without his consent. Sarah tries to make the best out of the given situation by cheering up Raj, which makes him feel guilty.

The trouble becomes double when Jeffrey comes to town to visit his daughter and son-in-law but spots Raju as a coolie at the train station. Jeffrey creates a ruckus, saying that Raju is a fraud who posed as a rich prince and married his daughter. Spontaneously, Raju pretends to not recognise Jeffrey and shoos him away.

Inspector Godbole arrives to arrest him, but Raju informs him that Mahendra is still alive and needs critical medical care, following which he escapes police custody. Raju runs to Deepak and both of them hatch a plan to pretend to be nurses to save Mahendra's life, as that is Raju's only proof of innocence. At the hospital, Inspector Godbole tells Jeffrey, Sarah and Anju that Raju is just a porter who pretended to be Kunwar Raj Pratap Singh.

While trying to save Mahendra, Raju and Deepak bump into Sarah and Anju. Raju confesses his fraud to Sarah, and she forgives him. Jeffrey and Sarah help Raju and Deepak stop Mahesh from killing Mahendra. Once he gains consciousness, Mahendra announces that since Raju saved his life, he is like a son to him.

The letter is from British mathematician Perci Trachtenberg , widely regarded as the world's greatest living mathematician, who invites Venkat to a high rolling casino in London. Venkat tells Perci about an equation that could not only change the dialogue on mathematics forever, but one that has already left an indelible impression of guilt — for many painful reasons — on Venkat's life. It is shown in the past that the reclusive genius Venkat has cracked a theory that could redefine the principles of probability and randomness. Venkat tries to use this experiment in a game called Teen Patti , which he plays on the Internet. According to this experiment if a person playing Teen Patti knows the three cards with one of the players  he/she can guess the other cards with the rest of the players and therefore can guess who is going to win with the theory of probability.

Venkat succeeds on his theory and submits his report to the institute where he teaches, but they reject his report. Venkat is sure about his theory and wants to try out in reality with live players. So he talks with younger professor Shantanu Biswas  about his theory and tells him to get three students to try out this experiment. Shantanu arranges three students — Sid , the college rockstar; Aparna or Apu , the studious geek, who has a crush on Sid, and Vikram or Vikku , the boy next door. They come together and start playing the game. Venkat's theory, like the last time, proves to be successful. Venkat says that after a few more games he'll be sure to crack his equation and even be able to study it better. Shantanu tells him that he should try using his theory in the real world, where there are people who actually gamble and play Teen Patti, i.e. in underground dens or ""addas"".

Although Venkat has no interest in the money that could come from practicing his equation to crack Teen Patti, he eventually succumbs to Shantanu's charismatic persuasion. Soon, with the help of his new students, they explore the addas of wild Bombay. Later another student from the institute, Abbas , the rich spoiled brat joins the gang and arranges for them parties in casinos, private clubs, etc. But what starts out as an experiment between a charismatic young professor and an eccentric older one soon descends into a game neither of them can control. The money they earn gets stolen; someone is blackmailing them; they get greedy about money and, in the course of time, they change into different people and even start betraying each other.","['Crime', 'Drama', 'Thriller']",A disgraced professor recounts his career and involvement with gambling.,"Super 30,Raja Natwarlal,Pagalpanti,My Client&apos;s Wife,Rakhta Charitra,Bachchhan Paandey"

Both run a movers and packers company called ‘Gently Gently’. Amreek has a laidback and carefree attitude and doesn't believe in owning up to his mistakes. This affects his work and also his relations with Radha. Fed up with his behaviour, Radha breaks up with him. Amreek is devastated.

This is when his father, Gurkeerat aka Gurki calls him from his home in Amritsar. He tells Amreek that he should return immediately as his grandmother, Sardar Kaur, is sick. Sardar, aged 90, has a tumour. The doctors advise Gurki that they should take her home as operating her at this age can prove fatal. Gurki realizes Sardar doesn't have much time but he hides this fact from Sardar.

Sardar, meanwhile, has a wish. She wants to go to Lahore and visit the house that she built with her husband, late Gursher Singh in 1946. A year later, during Partition, Gursher was stabbed to death while fighting the rioters. Sardar however escaped and reached India. Since then, she has been missing Gursher and the house. Hence, it's her desire to visit Pakistan so that she could see her ancestral house. Sardar tells Amreek about it.

Gurki advises Sardar that she can't travel in this condition. But Amreek realizes how much this means to her. He promises her that he'll help fulfil her wish. He tries to get her visa. However, her application is rejected as she's blacklisted from visiting Pakistan. This is because a few years ago, she had attacked a Pakistani official, Saqlain Niazi when she had gone to watch an India vs Pakistan cricket match in Mohali.

This is when Amreek learns that Radha has transplanted a nearly hundred-year-old tree in the United States. Amreek thus begins to learn about structural relocation and realizes that a lot of people have successfully lifted a house and transplanted it to a different location. Amreek requests help from both the government of India and Pakistan for his mission. Both decide to help him, in principle. Amreek then decides to visit Lahore. However, he hides about his plan from Sardar. He fears that if he fails in his endeavour, she'll be heartbroken. Hence, Amreek pretends to go back to Los Angeles in front of Sardar.

Amreek reaches Lahore and is successfully able to find Sardar's house. But when he reaches there, he sees that the local authorities are about to demolish the structure. But he stops it and manages to convince the mayor  he brings back the house, thus fulfilling Sardar's wish.

Aishwarya is a new student who befriends Sam on her first day, and the two fall in love at first sight. A Shakespeare play approaches in which Aish automatically gains the role of Juliet, much to the chagrin of her classmates. Sam tries his level best to learn the lines of Romeo so as to impress Mrs. Das and gain the role of Romeo. He succeeds in the end.

The next two friends, Tariq Naqvi and 'Nandy Bull' Nandini Oberoi, love to fight and argue with each other, but do not understand that they are in love. Nandini's parents don't spend any time with her and are always travelling. In the absence of her parents, she goes to illegal clubs and parties every day and spends money lavishly. Tariq, on the other hand, is burdened by his parents to achieve their dream of studying in MIT.

They realise their love for each other during Nandy's struggle to get approval of her apology after she forwards Tariq's MIT denial letter, oblivious that he had not read it himself. Sam gives a party in Hellfire but then there's a raid and he gets arrested while saving Aish. The two corrupt policemen try to bag ₹50,000 from Sam. He tries his best to avoid the policemen and tries to pay them in instalments. Aish breaks up with him because when during the party, Nandy's toyboy offers him a drag, even though Aish begged him to leave, he agreed to smoke weed because the toyboy makes fun of him and asked him to be a man. After she heard that Sam had sacrificed himself to save her, they make up.

Meanwhile, Aish is being offered a movie contract that she doesn't want to do. During a meeting, she rips the contract and runs to meet Sam and the others and continue their practice for the competition.

Aish didn't know about the money he owes the policemen and does not understand the reason of his anger. She runs into the streets, distraught and crying, only to be hit by a car and go into coma.

While dropping Aishwarya's clothes, Tariq and Nandy notice Aishwarya's phone has an electronic diary and reads it. It shows her point of view about everyone in the group and talks about how their parents have pressurised them.

They perform the song ""Antenna"" to convey their thoughts. Sameer uncovers the policemen's intentions to the Commissioner, while Aishwarya recovers and reconciles with him.

Kabir gets irritated, and one night tells him that he is a ""fake"" hero too, for his stunts are performed by doubles. Feeling humiliated, he leaves home, and is soon kidnapped by the cartoons his son watches. They kidnap him for they overhear two people talking and saying that Aditya is a famous hero.

5316648,Blind,Crime Drama Thriller n’t killer driver police orphanage force girl car accident death back serial descent,Crime Drama Thriller blind leaves life twist fate summon ounce courage rebuild crime criminal sole witness heinous unwittingly enters deadly game cat,"The story revolves around Gia, a cop of Indian descent working in Glasgow, Scotland. Gia, in an attempt to ground her brother, Adrian, cuffs him in her car but meets with an accident which takes Adrian’s life and Gia’s eyesight. Blind and hopeless, Gia resolves to pick herself up and tries joining the police force again, but is declined. Living with the darkness seems to be her fate until one day, her path collides with a serial killer who poses a challenge to her that might just be what Gia needs to regain her faith in life. 

Gia, a young cop working for the Scottish police force, is a smart and conscientious worker, but she never suspected that her qualities would work against her the day she went looking for her brother, Adrian. Actually, Gia and Adrian aren’t related by blood. They were left at an orphanage twelve years ago, and since then, she has been taking care of younger Adrian just like a real sister would. When she finally finds Adrian in a local club where he is enjoying a concert by his favorite artist, she takes him away against his will and cuffs him to the car after he tries to flee. Adrian tries to get the key while Gia is busy driving the car, and in a momentary loss of concentration, Gia takes her eye off the road to stop Adrian and meets with an accident. She didn’t know that the night would end in Adrian’s death, while she would be left with permanent vision loss and a pang of guilt that would weigh heavy on her heart for the next three years.

Alone, living away from the orphanage, she has only her guide dog Elsa to ensure she manages to navigate the city all by herself. In the aftermath of the accident, the police force could not let Gia go unreprimanded for the misuse of the law, which might have resulted in Adrian’s death. Firstly, she had wrongfully used her cuffs on him, for he wasn’t a criminal, and secondly, she had taken her eyes off the road, which was a case of negligence on her part. Her visual impairment meant she couldn’t return to work in the field, but even after three years of learning braille, her request to be of use to the police force at a desk job was also not entertained. Her record as a cop was forever tainted. The police force was not going to pardon the fact that she had broken the law to use the cuffs for personal reasons, and restrained Adrian to keep him acting like an impertinent child a day before his exam. If Adrian was alive, he would testify to that fact. But he is no more, and Gia has to live with the fact that she will never work for the police force again.

The orphanage’s caretaker, Maria, who had been a mother figure to Gia, regularly kept in touch because she knew that Gia was not in a good headspace. She knew that Gia needed assistance but wouldn’t accept it, as she thought it would keep a shred of dignity alive. Maria tried her best in the last three years to make Gia turn to religion again and reconcile with God, but she had completely lost her faith. Was her crime so grave as to merit such a harsh punishment? With no way to rejoin the police force, everything seemed lost for her. She doesn’t know that her future has her coming face-to-face with a serial killer.

With not much else to do the whole day, Gia keeps herself busy by listening to the news broadcast. The disappearance of a young woman keeps running through her mind. One day, while returning from Maria’s orphanage, Gia boards a taxi, completely unaware that she is moving towards her painful death. The driver of the car was a serial killer who had kidnapped the missing girl and was going for his second victim that night. He underestimated Gia, who was as much a cop now as she was before her accident. When the driver gave her the drugged water, she refused to drink it and started questioning him about the sound coming from the trunk of the car. The driver raises the volume of the car’s speakers, but when her attention isn’t diverted from the open trunk, he tries to force the bottle on her and ultimately runs over a woman. Gia’s belongings fall on the car’s floor due to the impact; she picks them up, leaves behind her disability card, and goes to check up on the driver. She realizes he put something in the trunk and proceeds to call the police, but the driver attacks her. Gia is able to use her skills to save herself from being abducted.

Having gone through the harrowing experience of nearly getting abducted, Gia was a little shaken up, but that didn’t stop her from contacting the police when she heard the news of a second missing girl. This was her chance to help the police nab whoever the kidnapper was. She had a hunch that the two disappearances were linked and the driver was possibly a serial killer, which meant she had to act fast if she was to save those girls. The trouble for her was that the police officers were not taking her report seriously. She was determined not to let her impairment come into play in this case. She persisted until Prithvi Khanna, a food-loving officer of Indian descent, took an interest in her unique abilities. At first, he was like all the other officers, not paying any heed to her account of the incident, but when she accurately describes Prithvi’s age, height, and food habits, he is amazed by her sensory deduction skills.

Gia had vital clues that could narrow down the list of potential suspects. She had talked to the driver, and he had revealed himself to be of Indian descent. By his voice, she could tell his age. He wore a unique perfume and wore a watch on her right wrist, implying he was a lefty. The scuffle revealed the driver’s height and build. Prithvi notes all this down and starts to track all the taxis in Glasgow that were run by men of Indian descent. If what Gia was saying was correct, the killer would be caught in no time. There was a problem, however: The driver did not drive a regular taxi, and this fact was known to only one other eyewitness, a young man by the name of Nikhil.On the night when the driver tried kidnapping Gia but instead ran over another girl, Nikhil was on his way home when he saw the accident. When he sees the second girl’s ‘missing’ poster, he contacts Prithvi. He tries narrating his eyewitness account but falters at one point. According to him, the driver ran over the girl and put her in the back seat, while Gia countered that it wasn’t possible as she was sitting in the backseat, so he must be lying. She dismisses him as just an opportunistic fellow trying to cash in on the reward for giving any information about the missing girl. Nikhil is livid with Gia’s attitude but later calls Prithvi to admit that he was lying about the part about the backseat, as he ran away after seeing the accident. He does assert that Gia’s information about the driver’s vehicle being a regular taxi was completely incorrect. His rant leaves Prithvi and Gia doubtful of their strategy because if it wasn’t a taxi, then their whole hunt would be useless.The driver had Gia’s disability card, and he started toying with her mind because he liked torturing his victims before he finally killed them. First, he starts to harass her by delivering the card in person, ensuring to send the waves of terror quite deep into Gia. Next on his list was Nikhil, who was an eyewitness and had to be eliminated. He attacks Nikhil, but he survives the blow, ending up in the hospital. Gia feels extremely upset, as she didn’t trust him before, and the whole fiasco reminds her of how she was a little harsh with Adrain too. She started to care for Nikhil as if he were Adrian. She realized that the killer coming to her doorstep was an act of posing a challenge, and she wasn’t one to simply back down from it. Sensing Nikhil to be deeply hurt and in danger, the sisterly love in her galvanized to take the shape of a mission—to stop the killer at all costs.Before she could do that, Nikhil went away, as he was still upset by Gia’s attitude toward him. He didn’t understand that she just cared for him, sensing that the killer would attack him again. She had lost Adrien, and she didn’t want to lose Nikhil as well. Meanwhile, the mental games being played by the killer did not seem to end. But this time, Gia was prepared. When he calls her, thinking he would torture her further by repeating to her the incident of handcuffing Adrian, which possibly led to his death, Gia gives him an earful about how he was simply an impotent fellow who could gain pleasure only by torturing helpless women. She manages to get under his skin, which also means he could come back with a vengeance, and unsurprisingly, he does. This time he attacks Gia, but her guide dog Elsa becomes his victim. Elsa’s death almost breaks all her resolve. She starts to accept the darkness and begins treading the path of hopelessness when another girl is kidnapped. This time, Prithvi and Nikhil try to solve the case together and almost nab the killer. Nikhil identifies his vehicle, and Prithvi tries to narrow it down to owners of Indian descent. He discovers that whoever the serial killer is, he works in the hospital because the drug he tried to use on Gia to subdue her was available nowhere except in hospitals. They were on the right track, as the killer was a gynecologist who, in a chilling fashion, was possibly scouting for his next victim among his clients.

Prithvi asks Nikhil and Gia to go to the orphanage while he goes to check on the last few remaining suspects. The killer, however, manages to kill Prithvi and uses his phone to find out where Nikhil and Gia are hiding. Back at the orphanage, Nikhil and Gia bond over Adrian’s music and his love for rap and concerts. Adrian’s death anniversary was coming up, and a concert was to be organized in his memory, but Gia had refused as she couldn’t forgive herself for what had happened that day. With Nikhil by her side, it was as if Adrian had come back, but the killer was coming to destroy that sentiment. He reaches the orphanage and, in an intense battle, stabs Nikhil and goes to hunt Gia. Blind and terrified, Gia manages to help Nikhil out of the orphanage, but she knows that if she doesn’t end the killer’s chapter right now, she will be haunted for the rest of her life. Mustering courage, she goes back to the orphanage and uses her own techniques to sense the killer’s whereabouts, ultimately killing him with such ruthless bashing that his eye pops out of his skull. She didn’t wait for the law, which again implied her same tendency to go overboard with her righteous mission as she did by cuffing Adrian. After facing malevolence, she may have become the devil in disguise herself, following the principle of “an eye for an eye”, but killing him was the best thing she had done in a long time. In the end, Nikhil helps bring Adrian’s music to life, taking Gia along with him to Adrian’s memorial concert, and gives Gia a new guide dog named ‘Hope,’ literally implying she has overcome her guilt and found the faith she had lost.

Inspector Imran Shahid, who is also Sona's ex-boyfriend, visits her house to collect evidence against Joy in a serial killing case. Sona thinks Shahid is just trying to frame Joy to take revenge on him for taking away his love.

The serial killing case is that of six girls who went missing; their bodies were found in an isolated house owned by Joy. All the victims were unmarried and pregnant and were then aborted and dismembered. Joy, a gynaecologist, is arrested and the town's people lose respect for him. Sona, who firmly believes that Joy is innocent and framed by Shahid, visits Joy in prison, and Joy tells her to ask a famous lawyer Mr. Rastogi for help, whom he had saved before. Joy's bail application is rejected by the court for all found evidence is against Joy. Rastogi suggests that Sona prove Joy's innocence by killing one more girl in the same way the previous six were killed to prove that the killer is not Joy.

Sona is a kind person and unwilling to hurt anyone but finally agrees after she is convinced that there's no other way to prove Joy's innocence. She chooses her neighbor Anushka Tiwari, an unmarried pregnant girl. News of Anushka's death reaches police, making the court believe Joy is not the killer. He is granted bail.

After Joy returns home, Sona shows him Anushka, who is still held captive by her. Sona didn't actually kill her, but found an unclaimed body and dressed it up to make it look like Anushka's body. Meanwhile, Anushka's boyfriend Sid follows them and finds that Anushka is actually alive in the basement of Joy's clinic. Sid tries to free her but accidentally locks himself in the cupboard.

Sona wakes up in the night to find Joy missing. She drives to the clinic immediately to find Joy about to kill Anushka. Sona now realizes that he is indeed the killer of the six girls. Joy revealed his mother got pregnant with him out of wedlock and abandoned him. Ever since Joy hates girls who gets pregnant out of wedlock that's why he abort and dismember them. Sona tries to save Anushka but Joy pins her hand on the table with his scalpel. Sid is also tied up by Joy, but he manages to contact Shahid, who immediately arrives, only to be tied by Joy too. Joy is now going to abort and dismember Anushka right in front of them. Shahid manages to free himself and Sona, who gets Sid and Anushka to escape. During his attempt to kill Anushka, Joy accidentally stabs Sona after she throws herself in front of Sid and Anushka. Shahid stabs Joy from behind, presumably killing him.

Sona wakes up in hospital with Shahid beside her and learns she has lost her baby. He tells her that Anushka is not going to file a case against her because she saved her life. Joy is also saved by the doctor and alive, but escapes from the hospital before anyone is aware. Rastogi, who is now revealed to have known Joy's crime already, and possibly had a role in those killings, meets Joy and gives him shelter.","['Crime', 'Drama', 'Thriller']","When a doctor gets jailed for a string of shocking murders, his loyal wife sets out to commit a copycat crime to prove his innocence.","Hate Story 2,Jazbaa,Rahasya,Samrat &amp; Co.,Koi Jaane Na,My Client&apos;s Wife"

5638500,1920 London,Horror Mystery witch King amulet master mirror film exorcist husband spiritual life realm body begins confront opens princess,Horror Mystery spirit exorcism husband possessed evil woman turns lover perform,"The film opens with the life of Shivangi, the princess of a royal house in Sikar, Rajasthan, now living in London with her husband Kunwar Veer Singh. They are a happy couple until one day when Veer develops a minor illness that soon flares up into a disease, shrivelling his body and shrinking his head. Veer is hospitalized and his symptoms worsen – his body begins to contort unnaturally and he begins growling in strange languages. The doctors seem to diagnose it as tetanus, which is incurable. Shivangi is frightened; Veer is just not the same and Shivangi's handmaiden, Kesar Ma deems it black magic.

Kesar Ma thinks it is because Veer's father, the King, had two wives and the second wife wanted Veer, the heir, out of the way. The film moves to Rajasthan, where Shivangi and her family visit an exorcist to remedy Veer's condition. The exorcist attempts to confront the witch by entering the other realm through a mirror, but is soon expelled, being too weak to confront the witch. The exorcist refers the King to the most powerful spiritual master in the land, Mewar Baba, whose real name is Jai Singh Gujjar.

Shivangi shudders on hearing about Jai. Some years ago, she was deeply in love with Jai. Her uncle saw them together and attempted to blackmail her into sleeping with him. Jai stepped in between and fought off the uncle who promptly reported the matter to the King. Jai was charged with attempted murder. Shivangi inexplicably stood as witness against Jai and Jai was ultimately sent to jail for five years. Shivangi contacts Jai to help her save her husband. Jai flatly refuses, but Shivangi pleads to him for help and he finally agrees to go to London.

Jai investigates the matter and discovers that Veer's troubles began upon receiving a strange amulet as a gift from an unknown admirer in Rajasthan. The amulet transmitted the witch demon into Veer. Jai prepares Shivangi into reciting a spiritual chant to bind the witch to their mansion so that Jai can throw the locket into the Thames river, thereby freeing Veer. Shivangi maintains the chant over the witch's attempt to thwart it and Jai finishes the task. However, it is revealed that the amulet and the witch were dispatched by Jai himself, and as he prepares to leave London, Shivangi confronts him, asking him how he knows the source of the amulet. Jai admits his vengeance, saying that he wanted Veer dead. Shivangi reveals why she betrayed him years ago: When their affair was revealed, the King had ordered Jai to be killed. Shivangi had begged for his life and it was granted for the price of her betrayal. Now guilty and dismayed, Jai resolves to stay in London and free Veer from the witch.

Jai prepares his final assault on the witch. Jai invokes his own spiritual master through a letter. The master chastises Jai for acting in haste and then regretfully says that the witch will not leave without taking a soul. The master directs Jai to an abandoned church where he receives a set of charmed Celtic daggers. Jai prepares a charm to attack the witch. He enters the witch's realm through a mirror and recovers the amulet. The witch attacks ferociously and is about to stop Shivangi when Jai smashes the mirror, closing the portal and trapping himself in the realm, so Shivangi can burn the amulet and free her husband. Shivangi sees Jai smile peacefully from a last shattered piece of the mirror before it breaks as Veer comes to life. After two weeks, Veer and Shivangi find the letter of correspondence between Jai and his master. Jai had offered his soul so Veer could be freed. Veer is touched and places Jai's photograph upon his mantelpiece as the film ends.","['Horror', 'Mystery']","After her husband is possessed by an evil spirit, a woman turns to her former lover to perform an exorcism.","1920: Evil Returns,My Client&apos;s Wife,Kaali Khuhi,Ek Paheli Leela,Roohi,Rowdy Rathore"

To cope up the pain she started heavily drinking, she became so relied on alcohol that it eventually broke her marriage with Shekhar moving on and marrying Anjali.
Mira rides the train every day being unemployed with the sole purpose of seeing Shekhar and Anjali in the home she used to once live in. While seeing her house every day from the train window she also comes across the happiest moment of her day where near Greenwich station stays a woman .

Nusrat's colleagues were the ones filing the report and they mention how she had gone to her dance instructor's party with them only for them to lose track of her eventually. The police questions the dance instructor Rajiv who mentions that he dated Nusrat casually and hadn't met her that day. On questioning her dance mates, Officer Kaur gets to know about Dr Hamid proceed the psychiatrist that Nusrat used to go frequently to. On questioning him and watching the recording of his sessions with Nusrat, it's known that Nusrat was in an unhappy relationship, where her husband used to be abusive towards her. Also her dance instructor was never dating her. He also mentions on how one day after her dance session he had seen a unknown guy demanding money from Nusrat or he would have shown something to her husband Anand. When asked about it by Dr Hamid, Nusrat had replied that he was just an old friend. On questioning Anand on why he wasn't the one filing the missing report for his wife and seemed rather unaffected by the whole situation, Anand replies that they were heading to divorce because Nusrat was apparently cheating on him.The police then seem to have found a lead apparently in the dance studio basement where the mask wore by Nusrat and drops of blood are found. Cctv footage suggests that its Rajiv who forced himself onto Nusrat but its later found out its a different girl altogether and Nusrat had left the party almost immediately.In meantime we see Mira on the train the day Nusrat went missing. Mira narrates on how she felt something unusual about Nusrat that day, how she seemed upset. At this moment she sees a man embracing Nusrat, Mira is shocked to see that the man is not her husband and suspects that Nusrat is cheating. Before she can find out more the train moves and she loses the sight. Mira meets Priya and is constantly asking answers for why was Nusrat cheating. Mira and Priya end up taking a few more shots that enrages Mira more. The fact that Nusrat is cheating resonates with Mira as Shekhar had cheated on her with Anjali that ended up destroying her. In a drunken rage she opens her phone to record a video of her abusing Shekhar, but Priya stops her. While the video still recording we see Mira completely crashing down and explain how betrayed she feels by Nusrat's actions and how she wants to go to Nusrat's house grab her hair and smash her head in the table till she dies. Once alone and still unable to cope Mira reaches Nusrat's home. She rings the bell but no one answers then she notices Nusrat walking towards the pathway on the side of the house that led to the forest behind. We see her following Nusrat noticing same guy who blackmailed Nusrat clicking pics of Nusrat. She catches up to her then blacks out to return to high road station injured. She gets on the train and is completely intoxicated barely conscious only thing she sees outside the window are firecrackers bursting.Back in present day police have found Nusrat's body in the forest, with preliminary reports it seems her body was dragged to the spot where it was dumped. Cctv footage shows an intoxicated angry Mira. After Anand denied knowing her the police suspect that Mira might have murdered Nusrat as her citizen card is found nearby the body. The police trace her steps to Mira getting down at Greewich station at 6, to barge at Nusrat's door at 6.30. Then next she is seen at High Road station injured at 10.30.
Having a previous history of alcohol abuse she becomes the prime suspect.Present day Mira wakes injured and heavily intoxicated at her home. She tries to recall but to no avail. She finds a message on her phone with unknown number saying that she was in the forest and Nusrat is dead. She then finds a video of her that she accidentally recorded explaining how she wants to kill Nusrat. Scared she attends her support group/class where she explains on how after miscarriage she started using alcohol to heal herself, and how she became so dependent on it that she often became violent and forgot about it. She mentions on how celebrating Shekhar's promotion at home she has a drink too many and wakes in the morning only to Shekhar tell her how she hurled him with a corkscrew when he asked to stop drinking. Over multiple such stories she mentions how she got drunk at Shekhar's colleagues party and abused the host that caused Shekhar to get fired, and how on being asked to sign divorce papers she becomes enraged and breaks the mirror to no recollection. She is scared something similar had happened that day with Nusrat and she might have hurt her in her drunken state. She concludes that she has to remember that one night as that could be the only way out.
Post her session she meets Priya and before she can tell Priya anything, Kaur and Kunal show up asking her questions about that night. She lies that she doesn't recognize Nusrat, lies about her citizen card being stolen and lies about remembering anything about the night. This makes Kaur call her compulsive liar.
Since they don't have evidence they can't arrest her, they leave Mira who rushes to her doctor only to profess that she might have murdered Nusrat in drunken rage. Mira also contacts Anand, only to know the guy she saw Nusrat with was her psychiatrist, to this Anand admits that he wanted to Mira because he had hired a PI to follow Nusrat and he wanted to know how will police react to it. Mira comes back home only to be troubled by how angry she was in the video, and thus she ends up contacting the unknown number to know what happened that night. She receives a call from someone saying for a price she can know what happened in the forest. She agrees.
Before the unknown caller contacts back we see Kaur coming down to force her to plead guilty. Kaur explains that all evidence are against her and being a lawyer herself she should confess instead of trying to delaying investigation by bringing up the the psychiatrist. In meantime Kaur gets a call that explains that at time of death Nusrat was pregnant and also that Mira's blood was found nearby. Mira is to be arrested immediately but she requests to bring her medication from the washroom. Once inside Mira panics only to jump from her bathroom window. As the police barge inside the bathroom, Mira is seen escaping unharmed by the fall as she landed on a pile of garbage bags.
She runs and evades the police only to notice she had dropped her phone that got picked by Kaur.
Now on the run, to prove her innocence she meets the guy she saved from trial in start of the movie. She requests him some money, phone and a gun. She uses the gun to threaten Dr Hamid. He explains that Nusrat had called him over because she got to know the same day that she was pregnant but the baby wasn't Anands. He didn't know whose it was but she was texting him and was supposed to meet him that evening to sort it out. To find more clues about this new person who could have potentially murdered Nusrat she sets to the forest. There at the edge of the forest she finds a horse ranch whose owner denies seeing her or Nusrat ever.
Back at police station they find from Mira's phone that someone was extorting her for money. Kaur asks the data to be backed up and the phone be returned to her.
Mira is the station where she is unable to use her pass as its out of balance. When she goes to gets it recharged the technician mentions that her last trip was from High Road to Redford at 8.30 pm. She doubles checks with him before leaving. Meanwhile police know that she has been spotted at the train station and start searching for her. Mira in low profile attends the prayer service for Nusrat, where she notices an altar with her pictures, there she sees a picture of Nusrat's phone and recalls the ranch boy having the same phone. She retrieves Nusrat's phone and sim from the ranch boy. While exiting the station she comes across Shekhar's ex boss Zahra and her husband, she apologizes to them for her behavior. They seem have to no recollection of it, on insistence they tell her that that day at party she felt puckish so she napped in their study, while towards the end of the party She noticed how violent and aggression Shekhar got on Mira. On asked about Shekhar being fired, they tell Mira it had nothing to do with her but because of Shekhar's inappropriate behavior towards a female coworker. Zahra concludes that she was glad when she got to know about the divorce. This comes as a realization to Mira on how all her episodes of rage were tales fed to her by Shekhar and how Shekhar created scenarios, forced her to drink, injured himself or her and made her think that it's her fault.
Shaken to the core by this revelation Mira stops consuming alcohol.
In meantime she gets Nusrat's phone to work only to find that she was having an affair with Shekhar. She goes to High Road station to confirm her doubts and Cctv confirms her presence at the station 8.30 not 10.30. She asks about who provided the tape to the police and gives the technician money to keep her posted on the same. She contacts the PI hired by Anand, he turns out to be the person who was blackmailing Nusrat regarding sending her pics with Shekhar to Anand. He was also present that day in forest and was the one to ask Mira for money. Mira is about to meet the PI Walter when suddenly a car comes at hits him killing him. Before he dies he mumbles something about his house to Mira. Mira grabs Walter's phone and threatens Anand to give her Walter's home address or she will tell the police about him spying on his now late wife. Mira texts someone from Walter's phone saying that proof is at his house.
Once at Walter's house she sees all the prints of her and Shekhar and Nusrat in the forest. She calls Shekhar from Nusrat's phone only to have Anjali picking up and abusing Mira for calling. Once Shekhar comes on phone Mira connects on how all this while he had saved Nusrat's number under her name. She tells him to meet her at Walter's home, as she knew about him being the father.
Shekhar comes and tries to play dumb. To this Mira threatens him with the gun, he finally accepts that he had an affair with Nusrat, they worked at same hospital. They always met in the forest. It was same that day too but Mira came there and confronted Nusrat. Nusrat escaped and ran to him. This made him angry and he hit Mira multiple times finally pushing her on a rock that injured her and made her bleed. Once unconscious he returned to Nusrat. When she told him about her pregnancy and refused to get the baby aborted Shekhar in rage strangled her. She was threatening to get him arrested on the grounds of sexual exploitation.
Concluding the story he offers Mira vodka planning to manipulate her again, this time Mira doesn't fall foe his trap, he requests her to give him Nusrat's phone she agrees only to hit him and knock him unconscious.
Then as a major plot twist it turns out Shekhar hadn't actually murdered Nusrat, as he didn't have a motive to murder Walter. In flashback Mira is seen rummaging through photographs that Walter took only to remember that the car that hit him was same car she had seen before too.

5970844,Thugs of Hindostan,Action Adventure King Mirza Lord thugs location soldiers ship performance daughter challenge warfare attack turns meet,Action Adventure love story man power nation thrills seas epic adventure filled war,"In 1795, when the Indian subcontinent was known as Hindustan or Hindostan, King Mirza Sikander Baig is killed by John Clive. The residents of his kingdom are massacred, and the land is annexed by Lord Clive of the East India Company. The only survivors are his daughter, Zafira Baig, and general, Khudabaksh. Khudabaksh defeats the retreating enemy soldiers, and raises Zafira as his daughter, training her in the arts of warfare.

11 years later, Firangi Mallah is a small-time thug who fools people for money. For instance, he once gives the location of a travelling landlord to some thugs and takes money for it. Then he gives the location of the same thugs to British soldiers for money. Firangi turns into a routine informer for the company. Firangi aims to be a European himself , and hence dresses up as one in many circumstances.

Khudabaksh, now known as Azaad, leads a band of Indian bandits known as Thugs, who specialise in sea-based warfare and expose a serious challenge to Lord Clive and the expanding East India Company which had, by then, seized control of large parts of India. Lord Clive assigns his right-hand to counter the rising threat posed by the Thugs.

Firangi goes to meet Suraiyya, a dancer and performer and flirts with her. Suraiyya challenges Firangi to confess his feelings during her performance in front of the British officers. Firangi then turns up during her performance, disguised as a Viceroy but Suraiyya removes his prosthetics in the middle of her performance, revealing his disguise. Firangi is arrested and tasked by the East India Company to meet Lord Clive's challenge. He, with the help of his friend, manages to track Azaad at one of Azaad's attack on a British ship. He mistakenly saves Zafira's life by taking a bullet for her and Azaad takes him to their secret location for treatment. He appears before Azaad and asks him for recruiting him. Azaad accepts and begins to show confidence in him.

When Azaad and his men make a stop to pick up muskets from a local ruler who supports their cause, Firangi betrays them and lets the East India Company know about their location. When the forces of the East India Company surround the warehouse where they are meeting with the ruler, Azaad lets Firangi know that he knows Firangi has sold him out but he still believes that Firangi has some good in him. After a short duel, Azaad is about to fall to his death when Firangi saves him. Azaad sees that Firangi is conflicted with his feelings about working for the East India Company and asks him to help with his cause. Azaad then asks him to protect Zafira and then sacrifices himself by confronting the East India Company forces alone so that Zafira and Firangi can escape.

Firangi then goes to Clive for claiming reward and also trades the location of Azaad's remaining thugs. However, this is a trap as Zafira and Firangi attack the incoming ships. Clive, with the help of a prisoner, Bhure Lal attacks them. The thugs survive and then Firangi and Zafira go to Suraiyya who is going to perform on the Dussehra function and asks for her help where Clive will also come so they can kill him there. Initially hesistant to help them, Suraiyya is convinced upon Zafira's request, revealing that there is a revolution in her, too. There before the function, Clive reveals that Azaad is alive and has to be executed. Firangi betrays all the thugs to Clive. However, this is a plan to release all the prisoner thugs including Azaad who survived but was captured by East India Company soldiers.

At the final encounter with the East India Company at an abandoned fort, Zafira fights the EIC soldiers while Firangi stops Clive from boarding his ship. Zafira kills Clive, and justice is served. Azaad looks to the sky and realizes the infertile land has now borne fruit, suggesting that Firangi has now become an empathetic human capable of greatness. The next day, Zafira is crowned the queen and declares her kingdom free of EIC rule. Meanwhile, Firangi along with Suraiyya and Shanichar are shown to have run away with a ship stolen from Zafira to England.","['Action', 'Adventure']",A story about one man's love for his nation and another's love for power.

This troubles his political rivals, who forge a plan to destroy his credibility with CBI Joint Director Satakshi Ganguly and Assistant Commissioner of Police Abhay Singh. The two plan to interrogate IAS Chanchal Chauhan, a close confidante of Ishwar, who is in jail for murdering her fiancé Shakti, Abhay's brother. To avoid attention, they shift her to Durgamati Bungalow, a dilapidated, supposedly haunted house in the outskirts of a city, for the interrogation. The CBI question Chanchal to get some clues against Ishwar, but she repeats that he is a good man and doubts his integrity without proof in a cryptic but leading manner.

Later that night, the spirit of Durgamati, the Queen of the house before independence, takes control of Chanchal. The CBI team calls upon a psychiatrist to investigate the matter, who concludes that Chanchal must be schizophrenic as she seems to take on a different persona and narrate some story from a book as if it were her own. He suggests that the CBI commit her to an asylum. However, Abhay suspects that this might be a ploy by her to escape and arranges for a spiritual guru to find out if there is paranormal activity. The guru suggests a few indicators. Later, Abhay discovers that those indicators indicate the presence of ghosts in the bungalow. He also finds Chanchal hurting herself under the influence of the spirit. This leads to Abhay taking Chanchal to a mental hospital.

Ishwar visits her at the mental asylum, and it is revealed that Chanchal had planned the entire thing to escape the CBI in return for a 300 Crore kickback from Ishwar. It is also shown that Ishwar had forced Chanchal to kill Shakti  to hide his scam regarding a welfare project.

Meanwhile, Satakshi realizes that Chanchal was trying to convey the truth of Ishwar's crimes using the story of Queen Durgamati, which she came across from the various writings and artifacts she had discovered in the bungalow. She also finds evidence of Ishwar's misdeeds and the site where he hid the villagers after killing Shakti with a gun.

Thus vindicated, Chanchal is seen running a charity organization in memory of Shakti. Satakshi then tells her that they thought they knew everything about her but never knew that she was a great magician in her childhood and learned Arabic. Chanchal replies by saying that she does not know Arabic, which shocks them, hinting that there was actual paranormal activity in the house.","['Horror', 'Thriller']","A bureaucrat is imprisoned in a haunted house for interrogation.

She is skeptical when her friend Honey's  aunt, a card reader, Sunita Rao , predicts that she will go to a foreign land and find the love of her life in seven days. She is pleasantly surprised when she is selected to go to a Youth Festival in Bangkok.

That is where Immy  enters. Immy is a complete opposite to what Priya wants in a guy. He smokes, drinks, and lies.

He moves to a new house in a big city called Mumbai with his friends. He likes to help his sister Radhika and her friend Andy with music for their fashion shows.

Radhika wants her friend Meera, who is a famous fashion model, to come to India for some fashion shows. But Meera doesn't want to go. So, Radhika and her friend Andy come up with a plan. They make Meera sleepy by giving her something to drink on the airplane. When they reach India, Meera realizes what they did and gets mad. But then she sees some girls from Rajasthan playing a special game and she starts playing with them and forgets about being angry.

In India, Meera meets a prince named Ranveer Singh. They become friends and later get married. The prince is having a problem with his cousin Bikram Singh over some land.

Meanwhile, when Karan is at home, he keeps having the same bad dreams over and over. Sometimes, he even wakes up in the middle of the night screaming ""Leela! Leela!"". His friends want to help him understand why this is happening, so they take him to someone who can read palm leaves and tell him about his past lives. The person tells Karan that his dreams are connected to something that happened a really long time ago, about 300 years ago.

With the Pandit's help, Karan goes back in time and learns that he is actually Shravan. Shravan loved a girl named Leela, but their teacher Bhairao became jealous and claimed Leela as his own inspiration. Bhairao made a statue of Leela and found out that she loved Shravan. Angry and upset, Bhairao pushed both Shravan and Leela into a pit of fire, ending their lives.

With help from Pandit, Karan feels brave enough to go to a place called Bhairao Virajana. It's a special place because Prince Ranveer and Bikram both think there is a really valuable statue hidden there. They want to find it because it's worth a lot of money.

Bikram discovers that Karan is going into his land without permission. He tells Prince Ranveer that people they don't know are coming onto their property.

In a big fancy building called a palace, there is a guy named Karan who sees a girl named Meera. Karan wants to make Meera remember things from their past, but Meera doesn't believe him. So, Karan plays a song that makes Meera remember that she used to be someone named Leela who was very pretty. Another guy named Bikram hears all their talking and realizes that if he kidnaps Karan and Meera, he can make them tell him where a special statue of Leela is hidden.

Meera and Karan are taken away by Bikram and his helpers. Bikram wants to find a statue that Bhairao made, which is worth a lot of money. He is being mean to Meera so she would tell him where the statue is hiding. To protect Meera, Karan tells Bikram where the statue is hidden. When Bikram goes to get it, Prince Ranveer comes and hurts Bikram with a sword.

In the end, Karan realizes that he was actually someone from a long time ago called Bhairao, not Shravan like he thought. He feels really bad about the things he did, so he wants to hurt himself, but Meera and Ranveer stop him and help him feel better.

Karan becomes very famous because of his album ""Tere Bin"" and the story has a happy ending.

Then, the dead person tried to kill Kabir with scissors, but Sanjana's spirit intervened and stopped her.

narrative in the whodunit genre which turns a quaint little
hill station into a dark world where death leaps out from the
imaginative mind of a sleazy crime thriller novelist and come
alive into the real world. The film revolves around Kabir who
is a very successful author struggling with a severe case of
writer's block compounded by the guilt of ghost writing cheap
bestselling pulp fiction. He meets Suhana a damsel in distress
who is a free spirit but struggles with her own nightmares, on

Hindi novels. But this heady mix of intense twists and turns
and chilling murders seem pale when Zaraan Khan the vigilante
character created by Kabir in his sleazy novels makes his
appearance in a human form baffling everyone involved and
blowing every possible theory up in the air and in the process
creating a whodunit that leaves the audience enthralled.

Harry realizes his flashes have a connection with Pasta's claims, and gets to know the past from him in Madhavgarh.

In 1419, Madhavgarh's Rajkumar Bala was banished by his father Maharaj Parikshitap for trying to kill him to become king. His servant Pehla Pasta took him to Sitamgarh  whose king Surya Singh Rana wanted grooms for his daughters. Bala planned to marry the eldest Madhu to become Maharaj and meets Bangdu, an effeminate dance teacher who's dating the second daughter Mala.

19289040,Jahaan Chaar Yaar,Comedy Drama women lives friends suggests revolves promising camaraderie title hearty dose fun story voices life film,Comedy Drama Goa married adventure journey friends set seeking solace ordinary lives find extraordinary,"As the title suggests, ""Jahaan Chaar Yaar"" revolves around the lives of four friends, promising a hearty dose of fun and camaraderie. However, the film, despite its initial premise, leans more towards drama than the anticipated light-heartedness. It explores themes of women seeking their own identities and voices, though it doesn't delve deeply into this aspect. With a runtime of 125 minutes, the movie sets the stage for the story of four women who embark on a journey to experience a taste of independence, temporarily liberating themselves from the daily grind of being middle-class housewives. 

The narrative commences by introducing Shivangi, who leads a routine life characterized by the relentless pursuit of household chores. She shoulders the responsibility of washing the family's clothes, preparing meals, and dining alone after everyone else is served, all without complaints. Next, we meet Sakhina, whose marital life is marred by troubles stemming from her inability to conceive. Tragically, despite her husband's role in their predicament, society remains deaf to her side of the story. 

Neha, the third member of this group, grapples with her husband's extramarital affair, a situation that has left her emotionally scarred. The final member of this tight-knit quartet is Mansi, who devises a clever ruse to convince her friends to join her on an excursion to Goa. The question that looms large is whether this break will prove to be a welcome respite for them or if it will irrevocably alter the course of their lives.

The film's narrative starts on an engaging note, interspersed with moments of humor. However, it eventually transitions into a more subdued and less enjoyable viewing experience. ""Jahaan Chaar Yaar"" touches on the importance of women discovering their individual identities and voices, yet the treatment of this theme lacks the depth and exploration it deserves.

The movie paints a poignant picture of the lives of these four friends, who seek moments of liberation from their everyday routines and societal expectations. It's a tale of self-discovery, friendship, and the pursuit of happiness, although the journey is not as light-hearted as one might expect.","['Comedy', 'Drama']",The journey of four married friends who set off to Goa seeking solace from their ordinary lives and find themselves in - an extraordinary adventure,"Parched,Gehraiyaan,Ascharyachakit!,Sadda Adda,Tribhanga,Lust Stories"

He has aged and is considerably older than the up-and-coming stars of the movies he is in. He tries to do his bit in the movies that he is a part of but is never praised. On the contrary, his unsolicited one-liners are ridiculed by the directors and even by his peer Anand. Trying to make it in the city, the constant strive for sustenance has made him enter the escort business, where he and Anand work under feared mafia boss Shahid, acting as pimps for a local politician, Chandresh Bhund. He had once taken a loan from Shahid’s man Mukhtar to produce his own film, but it was shelved, and Sheru never recovered the money. Mukhtar beats Sheru up, and he has to put up his house as collateral to make them not hit his face, which is his greatest asset as an actor. He gets a call from his hometown, where he still has his reputation as a film producer intact. Sheru’s dad asks him to marry a girl who fulfills all his requirements, with the bonus of receiving a handsome dowry for the wedding. Sheru liked the girl, and on top of that, he would have the money to pay back Mukhtar. Two birds were killed with one stone, and Sheru was delighted, but he didn’t know what he was up against when dealing with Tiku.Tiku is a feisty young woman who dreams of leaving the patriarchal set-up and living her dreams of becoming a heroine. She even has a boyfriend who has promised to make her a star once she reaches Mumbai. At first, she rejects Sheru, seeing his dusky look and the apparent age gap, but agrees immediately once she realizes that he is her ticket to Mumbai. She doesn’t know that he is embroiled in a shady business and is lying through his teeth about his fancy Mumbai life. Upon arrival, something quite different seizes her attention, though. Tiku realizes that she’s pregnant, and Sheru is faced with a dilemma.
Before the marriage can be consummated, Tiku has plans to run away with her boyfriend. Before she leaves, she is shocked to find that she is actually pregnant. The fact made her want to elope even more quickly, and she escaped while Sheru was away. Sheru could seem modern to her small-town gaze, but deep down, she had the same fears about him as her violent brother and father. If the news of his pregnancy came out in the open, he could turn violent. But Sheru wasn’t her most pressing problem. It was her boyfriend. The man she had trusted so blindly turned out to be a married man himself. Tiku’s fury knew no bounds, but when the man ran away after hearing the news of her pregnancy, she was left with no option but to kill herself.
Sheru comes back and finds that Tiku has run away. Discovering her through the help of the police, Sheru manages to locate her in a hospital. There, he learns about her pregnancy and is livid at Tiku’s secrecy. He isn’t able to come to terms with the fact that he got married to someone who was pregnant with someone else’s child. He tries sending her back, but Tiku tries killing herself again by jumping out of the car on her ride back home. Her guilt makes her stick to performing the role of a traditional wife, but Sheru is in no mood to appreciate the shtick. He goes to his acting job and has a change of heart.
Given the role of a father caring for a baby, he suddenly feels the joy of nurturing life, and in the act, he realizes that life was giving him a chance to do so for real, but he wasn’t accepting it. He comes back, drops his anger, and decides to accept the baby as his own, assuring that no further harm comes to Tiku from her family. Seeing him so selfless, Tiku, too, is filled with gratitude, and they start to form a relationship. Sheru becomes as passionate about Tiku as he is about acting, trying to ensure that she lives a luxurious life. After welcoming her baby into the world, he has a falling out with Shahid and is forced to start bringing in drug money to keep up the appearance of being a wealthy film producer and sustain his and Tiku’s lifestyle.
Tiku is quite happy with the lifestyle change, as she is from a small town and has always wanted to become a glamorous heroine. This was as close as she thought she was going to get. She had started to care for Sheru, for he seemed wealthy, but above all, he had gained the status of a generous, honest, and selfless man in her eyes. When she had proposed to abort the baby, Sheru had hysterically opposed that idea. Everything was going great until one-day, Sheru was caught by the police for his involvement in the drug business, and Tiku’s trust was shattered.

11112526,Indoo Ki Jawani,Comedy Drama time terrorist house Indi sex police girl find sexu delivery food reve terrorists living,Comedy Drama story misadventures dating apps girl experience life,"Indira Gupta a.k.a. ""Indoo"" is a girl living in Ghaziabad. She is in a relationship with Satish for the past year, who wants to have sex with her. Indoo always refuses as she thinks they should do it only after marriage. Indoo's best friend is Sonal, a knowledgeable girl. Indoo always consults Sonal and follows her advice whenever she is confused. As Indoo is beautiful and sexy, all men living nearby want to have sexual intercourse with her, including those as young as high school students and as old as her father.

Meanwhile, two terrorists from Pakistan are hiding in Ghaziabad after shooting a police officer in the arm. The police issue a wanted order for them on TV channels, and as they do not know the terrorists' faces yet, the only clue given is that they are Pakistani.

Sonal convinces Indoo to have sex with Satish to practice sexual intercourse and know if he has any sexual problems. Without telling Satish in advance, Indoo visits him the next day to have sex with him for the first time, only to find Satish sleeping with another married woman, Alka. Angered, Indoo breaks up with Satish. Sonal pins the blame for Satish's betrayal on Indoo for refusing to have sex with him. Sonal also persuades Indoo to have a one-night stand to practice sex. Following her advice, Indoo finds a partner on a dating app, Dinder, and fixes a date with him in her house while her family is on leave for a week.

Indoo's match is Samar, who is a musician from Hyderabad. Indoo is known as India to Samar since Sonal mistyped Indira while making Indoo's profile on Dinder. Though both know where the night will lead them, Indoo feels shy and nervous and keeps calling Sonal for suggestions. Samar orders dinner for them via a mobile app Gomato. Later, Samar's passport accidentally falls on the ground, which reveals him to be a Pakistani. Indoo, who happens to have seen the wanted order on TV, accuses Samar of being one of the Pakistani terrorists, but Samar denies it.

They begin to argue as people from two rival countries. Indoo wants Samar to leave her house but asks him to wait till the coast is clear so that no one sees a man leaving her house. After some twists, the food that Samar ordered arrives. Indoo invites the delivery man into the house to keep an eye on the ""terrorist"" while using the bathroom. Samar grabs this opportunity to force his way out of her house. Now it's the food delivery man who remains with Indoo in her house. She is forced to wait for a chance to send him on his way while the street is empty.

On his way back, Samar sees a dead body. Upon checking the corpse's ID, he realises that that person was supposed to deliver their food. He concludes that the man in Indoo's house must be a terrorist. As his phone battery is dead, Samar tries to seek help from passers-by and people in a prayer gathering near Indoo's house, but nobody listens to him. He informs to police that a local girl India is in danger and a dead body is lying nearby, but the policemen in deep sleep acknowledge that India is not a girl but a mother figure to its citizens. With no alternatives left to save Indoo, Samar returns to her house and barges in despite Indoo's refusal.

Samar confronts the terrorist and reveals his deeds, but Indoo still thinks that Samar is the real terrorist and does not believe him. Samar and the terrorist fight; Indoo hits Samar with a stick and renders him unconscious. Meanwhile, the police manage to find a photo of the terrorist and publish it on TV.

Indoo sits on the sofa which leads the remote to switch on the TV. She sees the TV and notices, learning that the ""delivery man"" is the real Pakistani terrorist and that Samar was trying to save her all along. She escapes and hides in the house. Unable to find Indoo, the terrorist points his gun at an unconscious Samar, threatening to shoot him if Indoo does not reveal herself. Indoo is forced to show herself while Samar wakes up at the same time. He snatches the terrorist's gun and fights with him. Ultimately, the police arrive on the scene and shoot the terrorist in this hand.

The movie ends with Indoo and Samar apologizing to each other as they lean in for a kiss. As they lean, the door bell rings making Indoo assume it must be their parents and blames Samar that his involvement with her caused all the problems.","['Comedy', 'Drama']",A coming-of-age story of a girl who experience life through misadventures & dating apps.,"Tevar,Love Sonia,Shimla Mirchi,Hacked,Secret Superstar,Saroj Ka Rishta"

4642936,Warrior Savitri,Action Thriller Warrior strong action story film modern named Bollywood movie mythology female character role Puri directed attempts love,Action Thriller major epics ancient modern day adaptation legendary fable husband adept martial arts save,"Warrior Savitri is a 2016 Bollywood action film directed by Param Gill. This is a modern adaptation of the legend of Savitri and Satyavan from the Indian epic Mahabharata. The film stars Niharica Raizada in the lead role of Savitri, Rajat Barmecha as Satyavan and Om Puri in a key supporting role. While Warrior Savitri does not have a star-studded cast, it attempts to incorporate elements of mythology, romance and action into a contemporary storyline.

This movie is about a woman named Savitri who knows how to fight and protect herself. She is very strong, likes to do things on her own, and never gives up easily. One day, she meets a man named Satyavan who has a secret past. They fall in love with each other, and their love story is the most important part of the movie.

But then something unexpected happens in the story. Savitri, who is really good at fighting, has to show off her skills. Satyavan gets into trouble with a bad guy named Rahu, who is very strong and dangerous. Rahu challenges Satyavan to a game that could hurt him a lot. Savitri has to use her strength, smarts, and fighting abilities to save Satyavan and keep him safe.

The movie has exciting, emotional, and spiritual parts. The main character, Savitri, is like a modern version of a famous character from a story. In that story, she saved her husband from a scary god. In this new version, the filmmakers want to show a strong and brave woman who will do anything to save the person she loves.

While 'Warrior Savitri' attempts to combine mythology with a contemporary narrative, it received mixed reviews from both critics and audiences. Some appreciated the attempt to create a female action hero inspired by a classic myth, while others found the execution lacking in various aspects, including the narrative and action sequences.

Even though ""Warrior Savitri"" wanted to be really successful, not a lot of people watched it and not many people know about it. But it did try something special by having a strong, action-packed female character, which doesn't happen very often in Indian movies.

In conclusion, 'Warrior Savitri' is a 2016 Bollywood film that takes inspiration from the timeless story of Savitri and Satyavan, an episode of Mahabharata. We strive to create modern stories that blend mythology, action, and romance, and feature strong and empowered female protagonists. The film may not have received widespread acclaim, but it blazed a new trail for Indian cinema, giving a modern twist to a classic legend.

Before she dies, her voice states that she wants to ask forgiveness for her sins. The film then flashes back to six months.

Izna, a former pornographic actress, is approached by intelligence officer Aayan Thakur . Aaryan and his father Security Chief Guru Saldanah  want to hire Izna as a 'honey trap' and help them retrieve critical information from Kabir Wilson , Izna's ex-boyfriend. Kabir used to work for the Intelligence Agency but went rogue and now operates as a hitman.

Izna tells Aayan and Guru Saldanah how she met Kabir six years ago; at the time, Kabir still worked for the agency. During one of his missions, he met Izna, who was unknowingly being used to smuggle drugs into a nightclub. That evening, Izna followed him home and handed him a love letter written in her own blood. They started dating until one day Kabir disappeared without telling Izna where he went. Although she desperately tried to find him, she was unable to and resigned herself from ever loving anyone again.

After Izna agrees to the mission, she is taken to a residential colony in Sri Lanka, where Kabir has been living as a musician for the last few months. Izna and Aayan go undercover as an engaged couple, with Aayan pretending to be Karan Rajput, a PR representative. To prepare, Izna is given a book with a detailed backstory on how she and 'Karan' met. Izna is then tasked to go to Kabir's house and introduce herself as his new neighbour. When Kabir sees Izna, he slams the door on her, which upsets her. Kabir tries to approach her the next day but she angrily throws a rock at him. He follows her and writes ""Sorry"" on her window in his blood but quickly walks away when he gets a phone call.

Guru Saldanah's team tries to extract the information themselves but are killed by Kabir. Saldanah narrowly escapes. Aayan plans to steal data from Kabir's laptop and asks Izna to distract Kabir. She sends a letter to Kabir telling him that she wants to meet him. After Kabir leaves his house, Aayan breaks in to steal the data. However, when he copies the data from Kabir's laptop, it triggers a silent alarm. After receiving an alert on his phone Kabir hurries back to his house. Aayan narrowly escapes with the data, but he later discovers that it had all been falsified information. After Aayan tells her how many people Kabir has killed, Izna promises she will bring Kabir down.

Kabir's trusted friend Sumit suspects that Izna is involved with the Intelligence Agency and warns Kabir about her. Kabir tells him he has no reason to suspect her. Kabir proposes to Izna and asks her to move in with him and leave 'Karan'. Izna accepts his proposal, thinking it would be beneficial to their mission. Aayan, who has since fallen in love with Izna, gets angry when he finds out. Izna tells him she believes she'll be able to steal the data more easily when she moves into Kabir's house. He agrees and she soon moves into Kabir's house. Kabir asks Sumit to find a priest to conduct the marriage. However, Sumit accidentally reads a text message from Aayan on Izna's phone, proving his suspicions that she's working with the Intelligence Agency. He attacks Aayan and tries to kill him, but instead is killed himself when Aayan shoots him. Aayan meets up with Izna to discuss the mission. He warns her that Kabir might try to kill her when he finds out that Sumit has been murdered and she is involved. Aayan gives her poison and asks her to mix it into Kabir's drink.

When Izna is not at home, Kabir goes to Aayan's house and notices Sumit's hearing aid on the floor inside. Kabir breaks into the house and ends up discovering the book with the story Izna had told him about how she met 'Karan'. He finally believes that Izna is working with the Intelligence Agency and waits for her. When she returns home she offers to make him coffee. However, she blends the poison Aayan had given her into the coffee she serves him. Kabir tells Izna that years ago, he had left Izna because he had found out during a sting operation that some of the Intelligence Agency's operatives, as well as some politicians and officers, were corrupt. Not wanting to work for a corrupt organization he had shortlisted them and then killed them. He tells Izna that he's a patriot.

Dumping out the poisoned coffee undrunk, Kabir tells Izna that Guru Saldanah is corrupt and that his team consists of impostors who are after incriminating data, which Kabir keeps stored on a hard disk. He states that Guru Saldanah is running an unsanctioned operation to retrieve the information and will kill Izna once he gets the hard disk. Kabir asks Izna to escape and offers her a new passport, tickets, and access to an account maintained at a Swiss bank from which she can withdraw unlimited money. Izna does not believe him though, and when Kabir kisses her she shoots him in the stomach, after which he dies. Running away with the hard disk containing the original data, she goes to Guru Saldanah and hands over the hard disk. However, she is quickly surprised to discover that Kabir was telling the truth and Guru Saldanah is indeed corrupt. He tells Izna that after the mission, she was supposed to have been killed. Aayan was given this responsibility, but he had changed his mind as he had fallen in love with her. As Guru Saldanah tries to kill Izna himself, Aayan tackles him and kills him instead.

Aayan asks Izna to give him the hard drive and come with him to start a new life together in Europe. Izna declines his offer and tells Aayan that because of his lies she killed the love of her life, an innocent man who blindly trusted her. She tells him that she would rather die with Kabir than spend another day alive with Aayan, and attempts to leave with the hard disk. Aayan threatens to shoot Izna if she doesn't change her mind. After Izna ignores him and leaves the house, Aayan follows her out in the yard and shoots her in the back. After she falls down Aayan approaches her and turns her over. Still alive, Izna who was still holding the gun with which she killed Kabir, shoots Aayan twice in the chest and instantly kills him.

Before dying, Izna sees a vision of Kabir, who tells her he forgives her. She tells him that without him, Heaven is not a heaven, and with him, she has no reason to be afraid of Hell.

Tabrez uses this to his advantage by first jacking the cockpit on the pretext of using the washroom and later pushing an asleep Chatterjee's leg out of the seat, which results in the attendant unwittingly losing control and spilling a drink over Penny, causing Malavika to burst into anger, while the pilots come out to resolve the dispute, and discover, to the horror of both themselves and unwittingly the passengers as well, that the flight has been left in autopilot mode, and since the door is jammed, the flight could possibly crash land. The ensuing commotion results in a middle-aged woman aboard the flight seeking out Chatterjee and Mukherjee for help, but in the officers' audacity to refuse, Chatterjee ends up unwittingly exclaiming loudly that Tabrez can open the lock. However, when Tabrez initially rebuffs the requests of the passengers, they, in all ire, free Tabrez from the two officers, and he, in turn, manages to open the cockpit for the pilots, thereby becoming a hero in the eyes of the passengers and is able to trick the police by poising, all dressed up, as a rich man.

Shortly after he relays this entire episode to his sidekicks Burger, Dollar and Soda, who have come to pick him up at the airport, Tabrez drives away and expresses his desire to go home and meet his mother and his wife, Aanya Khan, but Burger reveals that Aanya isn't at home and has been shooting for a film titled ""Sheila Ki Jawani"". Tabrez, visibly irked, decides to hijack the film's shooting, and in the process, smashes the director on his head and drags her home. Aanya protests, nearly exposing Tabrez in front of his mother, who is under the impression that he is a renowned film director himself. Chatterjee and Mukherjee appear at his house, but are thrown out by his mother and Aanya.

Tabrez next makes a deal with the Johri brothers to hijack the train with the help of a few unwitting villagers, who he is supposed to trick into doing so and smuggling the goods into a truck for the brothers, by posing as an international film director. During one of the two meetings in which this is finalized, well known superstar Aatish Kapoor arrives as a guest of honour at the local dandiya event where Tabrez and the Johri brothers are randomly chosen for the prize, but they are spotted by Chatterjee and Mukherjee and instead decide to flee by creating a commotion, causing Aatish to storm out in anger. Tabrez finds that Aatish enjoys police protection and relays this information to the Johri brothers, who decide that they will be the producers.

Tabrez, Dollar, Burger and Soda manage to steal equipment from a film set where actor Chunky Pandey is shooting, and land up in a village called Dhulia, where the chief, Nana Ghanpule and his blind associate, Subedaar welcome him. Realizing that the train passes through the only track in Dhulia, Tabrez settles on the idea of directing his film there, and, posing as an international director Manoj ""Day"" Ramalin the fair complexioned brother of award-winning director Manoj ""Night"" Ramalin, approaches Aatish, who agrees to the ""Oscar-winning"" project, despite the suspicions of his manager Bunty Baweja.

Tabrez comes up with the idea of a film centred in the pre-independence era, where Aatish would play a revolutionary, and Aanya would play ""Razia Sultana"" , and both of them would protest against Britishers. Midway through, the negatives run out, and one of Nana's associates  overhears this, deciding to raise a few 5-6 lakhs of rupees for Tabrez and the team. At night, since they have the keys to the local bank, Tabrez, Burger, Dollar, and Soda decide to rob the bank, but even as the villagers ""mistakenly"" assume them to be robbers, their escape and attempts to dodge a ghost-figure leads both the gang of thieves and the villagers to a hideout deep in the forest where several children who went missing from the village are recovered from a gang of militants, after which the entirety of villagers bows in front of Tabrez, who realizes that he made a grave mistake trying to deceive the villagers. Humbled by their gesture of 5-6 lakh rupees as a means of arranging film equipment, he decides that he will leave behind part of the looted treasure for the villagers, even as he trains the villagers in acting, among whom is the local cop, Inspector Dhurinder, as the train has been delayed by a week.

With everything set in motion on the day of the hijack, trouble seems to brew with the arrival of Singh, Jagtap, Chatterjee and Mukherjee, even as Tabrez finds his mother joining in after finding out through the unwitting Aanya. However, while he succeeds in tying up the four officers and escaping after successfully executing the entire caper, Singh recovers and slaps Dhurinder, informing the stunned villagers that the director who they met is a wanted criminal.

Along with his gang, Tabrez meets up with the Johri brothers and declares that he will leave behind a portion of the loot for the villagers, but the rather irked twins fool them and escape. Meanwhile, Dhurinder holds Tabrez at gunpoint until Singh arrives, and the entire village alter assembles with Tabrez against the officers in attendance, with the Judge deciding that only the guilt-ridden Tabrez be jailed, but while he misinterprets his sentence as that of 7 years, he is shocked to find that it is instead 60 years.

Outside the courtroom, Tabrez instructs Burger, Dollar and Soda to complete the film, titled Bharat Ka Khazana , Treasure of India ), and release it. At the premiere, he arrives handcuffed, but is found missing and thus escaped after Chatterjee and Mukherjee find Bunty in shackles instead. Singh realizes he has failed and is shocked.

Meanwhile, the Johri brothers are stunned to find Tabrez aboard their plane, with Burger, Dollar and Soda revealed to have hijacked it. Finding the twins adamant against his will, Tabrez throws them out with a parachute at their back. A song sequence, in the end, features Aatish finally receiving an Oscar award from the sensational actor Anil Kapoor, Aanya endorsing a hair removal cream.","['Comedy', 'Crime']","Posing as a movie producer, a conman attempts to trick an entire village into helping him rob a treasure-laden train.","Pagalpanti,Shaitan,Kuttey,Bloody Daddy,Bellbottom,Singham"

21403688,Operation Mayfair,Crime Thriller killer wom seri lly tion investig bec police scene forensic begins point home reliving crime,Crime Thriller based gritty language thriller detective hunts serial killer targets women,"Operation Mayfair begins by establishing the fact that there is a serial killer on the prowl who gets rid of his targets. Set in London, a tall, bulky man wearing a hoodie enters the home of Sarah Jones, a famous model in the country, who is alone and unguarded at that point. By the looks of it, the woman did not expect to be attacked by a stranger at this hour of the day. The man confronts this woman and begins to physically assault her by reliving the trauma he was put through by another woman. The man is not stopping at this point and forces the woman to get down on all fours so that he can complete his task. With the construction of this scene and the way this man is reliving a disturbing past, it is easy to comprehend that he is clinically insane and has suffered some deep trauma in his childhood. The trauma triggers his worst side, which pushes him to brutally assault the woman in her home. The man ends up killing the woman rather quickly and gets away from the scene of the crime. The man assumes he can get away with this killing. His confidence is his biggest weapon, and so far, it has helped him remain undetected by the police.Sarah Jones being a high-profile victim, puts pressure on the Metropolitan Police to find the killer. Lisa, the detective with the above-mentioned station, is leading the case, and she recommends that Amar join the investigative team. Lisa wants Amar on this team because a few years ago, the same serial killer was out committing similar crimes, and Amar was the lead investigative officer back then. Though he could not catch the culprit, he had ample knowledge about the case. Lisa’s trust in Amar and his understanding of the case allow the police commissioner to bring him in.

Amar would be able to give another perspective to this investigation, which would help them procure a new lead with the advent of technology. Amar is initially not interested in taking up the case because, previously, the same serial killer case managed to ruin his personal and professional life. But Amar is strangely drawn to this case because of his past involvement in it. This pushes Amar to help the police nab the serial killer. If they manage to catch the killer, it would be a big victory not just for the department but also a personal victory for Amar as well. Amar was very close to catching the killer in the past, but the person went missing.The serial killer happens to be Kevin Da’Costa, who, to the viewer’s surprise, works for the police department’s forensic team. Kevin works for the law-and-order system, and this allows him to stay ten steps ahead of the police. With every murder he commits, he makes sure to leave no DNA or evidence around. Being the forensic lead gives him the liberty to manipulate the crime scene’s findings. Kevin carries out the murders in the same fashion as before, and by the looks of it, he is in no mood to stop.

Kevin himself has a family but does not have good relations with his wife. Kevin’s past has made sure he does not communicate with his wife, but somehow his kid from the marriage allows Kevin to stay connected to reality. The only good memories that Kevin has are of his father teaching him to play the piano and reading Shakespeare’s play, The Tempest. Both have had a huge impact on him because to get rid of the urges and the pain of his abuse, Kevin indulges in playing the piano in his hideout. The line from “The Tempest,” which resonates with Kevin a lot, is about how the  past is connected to the future. It can have a positive connotation, but in Kevin’s arc, his history of being abused has a connection to his turning into a serial killer. His stepmother’s verbal and physical abuse left a deep impact, and it is visible through his modus operandi. His smartness lies in the fact that he has not been caught yet. Kevin is unwilling to deal with the trauma the right way, which is to approach a psychiatrist. But instead, he exploits his position as the forensic team leader to derail the investigation.
